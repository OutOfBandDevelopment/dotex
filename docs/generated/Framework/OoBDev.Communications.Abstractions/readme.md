**Summary**

The OoBDev Communications Abstractions library provides an abstract layer for sending messages asynchronously over dedicated channels, such as Email and SMS. The library consists of interfaces and implementations that enable developers to interact with various channel providers, allowing for a decoupling of the message sending logic from the specific channel implementation.

**Technical Summary**

The OoBDev Communications Abstractions library employs the Dependency Injection pattern to manage the dependencies between the interfaces and implementations. The `ICommunicationSender<>` interface is the central point of interaction between the service classes and the channel providers. The library uses the `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Abstractions` package to provide configuration options for the channel providers.

This component diagram shows the OoBDev Communications Abstractions system, which consists of two packages: OoBDev.Communications and Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Abstractions. The former contains the `ICommunicationSender<EmailMessageModel>` interface and the `EmailMessageModel` class. The latter provides the `IConfiguration` interface for managing configuration options. The Example Class system uses the `ICommunicationSender<EmailMessageModel>` interface and the `IConfiguration` interface.

Please note that this is a simplified representation of the system and might not include all the components and dependencies present in the actual system.
