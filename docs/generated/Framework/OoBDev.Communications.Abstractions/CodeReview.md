As a senior software engineer/solutions architect, I'll provide a review of the code, suggesting changes to improve its maintainability, structure, and functionality.

**Review**

1. The project file (.csproj) is well-structured, and the settings for the framework, naming, and documentation generation are properly configured.
2. TheREADME file provides a clear summary of the OoBDev Communications library and examples of its usage.
3. The code snippet in the README file demonstrates the usage of the `ICommunicationSender<T>` interface, but it lacks implementation and concrete channel providers.

**Suggestions**

1. **Separate Concerns**: Consider splitting the `OoBDev.Communications.Abstractions` project into separate projects for:
	* `OoBDev.Communications.Contracts`: for interface definitions (e.g., `ICommunicationSender<T>`)
	* `OoBDev.CommunicationschannelProviders`: for concrete channel providers (e.g., email, SMS, etc.)
	* `OoBDev.Communications`: for the actual implementation of the communication sender
2. **Rename `OoBDev.Communications.Abstractions`**: Renaming the project to `OoBDev.Communications.Contracts` would better reflect its purpose.
3. **Move `Readme.Communications.Abstractions.md` to `OoBDev.Communications.Contracts`**: The README file should be relocated to the project where the contracts are defined, making it easier to find and link to the relevant interfaces.
4. **Reorganize the `ExampleClass`**: Instead of injecting `ICommunicationSender<EmailMessageModel>`, consider having a dedicated email sender class (`EmailCommunicationSender`) that implements the `ICommunicationSender<EmailMessageModel>` interface. This would make the code more concise and easier to test.
5. **Add documentation comments**: Add XML comments to the interface definitions and class implemented interfaces to provide more detailed documentation for consumers of the API.
6. **Consider dependency injection**: Implement dependency injection to allow for more flexibility and testability. This would enable you to easily swap out different channel providers or implement additional ones.
7. **Use async/await best practices**: In the `ExampleClass`, consider wrapping the `await email.SendAsync(message);` line in a `try`-`catch` block to handle any exceptions that might be thrown.
8. **Implement channel providers**: Provide concrete implementations of channel providers, such as email and SMS, in separate classes that inherit from the `ICommunicationSender<T>` interface.

**Example of improved code structure**

**OoBDev.Communications.Contracts**

* `ICommunicationSender<T>` interface
* `IEmailCommunicationSender` interface (derive from `ICommunicationSender<EmailMessageModel>`)

**OoBDev.CommunicationschannelProviders**

* `EmailCommunicationSender` class (implements `IEmailCommunicationSender`)
* `SmsCommunicationSender` class (implements `ICommunicationSender<SmsMessageModel>`)

**OoBDev.Communications**

* `CommunicationSender` class (implements `ICommunicationSender<T>` and uses channel providers)

By applying these suggestions, the code will become more maintainable, scalable, and easier to understand.

**Additional considerations**

1. Consider implementing a factory class to create instances of channel providers, allowing for more control over the creation process.
2. Implement logging and error handling mechanisms to ensure that exceptions and errors are properly handled and reported.
3. Perform unit testing and integration testing to ensure the correctness and reliability of the code.

By following these suggestions, the OoBDev Communications library will become a robust and maintainable solution for asynchronously sending messages over dedicated channels.
