As a senior software engineer/solutions architect, I'll review the provided source code and suggest changes to improve maintainability, coding patterns, methods, structure, and classes.

**ContentChunk.cs**

1. **Rename the class**: Consider renaming the `ContentChunk` class to something more descriptive, like `FileChunk` or `ContentSegment`.
2. **Improve constructors**: Instead of having a constructor with four parameters, consider having two constructors: one with optional parameters (e.g., `Sequence` and `Start` with default values) and another with all parameters required. This will make it easier to create instances of the class.
3. **Properties**: Consider making the `Data`, `Sequence`, `Start`, and `Length` properties read-only by using the `get;/` syntax. This will prevent unintended modifications of the properties.

**FileMetaData.cs**

1. **Rename the class**: Consider renaming the `FileMetaData` class to something more descriptive, like `FileInformation` or `FileInfoMetadata`.
2. **Properties**: Consider making the `Uuid`, `Path`, `Hash`, and `BasePath` properties read-only by using the `get;/` syntax. This will prevent unintended modifications of the properties.
3. **Initializing values**: Instead of having a constructor with all parameters required, consider having a parameterless constructor and initializing the values in a separate method (e.g., `Init(string uuid, string path, ReadOnlySpan<byte> hash, string basePath)`). This will make it easier to create instances of the class.

**ITempFile.cs**

1. **Simplify interface**: The `ITempFile` interface has only one property (`FilePath`). Consider simplifying it to a standalone `string` method (`GetFilePath()`) or a property with a getter.
2. **Implement Dispose**: Since `ITempFile` implements `IDisposable`, consider implementing the `Dispose()` method in the implementing classes to properly release resources.

**ITempFileFactory.cs**

1. **Consider using an abstract class**: Instead of an interface, consider using an abstract class to provide a default implementation for the `GetTempFile()` method. This will make it easier to create concrete implementations.

Additional suggestions:

* **Consistent naming conventions**: Ensure that the naming conventions are consistent across the codebase. For example, use PascalCase for classes and parameters, and camelCase for local variables.
* **Code organization**: Consider organizing the code into separate folders or projects based on functionality or layers (e.g., `OoBDev.IO.Files`, `OoBDev.IO.TempFiles`).
* **Exception handling**: Implement proper exception handling and logging mechanisms to handle unexpected errors.
* **Code analysis and testing**: Run code analysis tools (e.g., CodeLens) and write unit tests to ensure the code is correct and maintainable.

Overall, the code appears to be well-structured, and these suggestions are intended to improve maintainability, readability, and scalability.
