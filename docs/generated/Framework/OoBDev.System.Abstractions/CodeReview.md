I'll review the provided source code and provide suggestions for improvement.

**ConfigurationMissingException.cs**

1. **Inheritance**: The `ConfigurationMissingException` class derives from `ApplicationException`, which is a subclass of `Exception`. Considering the `ConfigurationMissingException` class is a custom exception, it's a good practice to derive from `Exception` directly instead of `ApplicationException`. This simplifies the inheritance hierarchy and minimizes coupling.

Suggested change:
```csharp
public class ConfigurationMissingException : Exception
{
    // ...
}
```
2. **Constructor**: The constructor uses a string interpolation to set the exception message. This is a good practice, but consider adding a separator character (`}`) between the interpolated string and the closing bracket (`}`) to improve readability.

Suggested change:
```csharp
public ConfigurationMissingException(string configurationKey) :
    base($"Configuration \"{configurationKey}\" is missing.")
{
}
```
3. **Documentation**: The XML comments provide a good summary and remarks, but consider adding additional details about the exception's behavior, recommended handling, and any specific requirements for resolution.

Suggested change:
```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Represents an exception thrown when a required configuration is missing.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This exception is typically thrown when attempting to access a configuration value that is not present.
/// To resolve the issue, ensure that the required configuration key is present in the configuration file.
/// </remarks>
```
**OoBDev.System.Abstractions.csproj**

1. **Target Framework**: The project targets `net8.0`, which is the latest available framework at the time of writing. Consider updating the framework to a newer version if possible, to take advantage of newer features and improvements.

Suggested change:
```xml
<TargetFramework>net7.0</TargetFramework>
```
2. **ImplicitUsings**: With the `ImplicitUsings` property set to `false`, you explicitly need to include using statements for each namespace. This can improve maintainability by making dependencies explicit.

Suggested change:
```xml
<ImplicitUsings>false</ImplicitUsings>
```
3. **GenerateDocumentationFile**: The project generates a documentation file, which is a good practice for maintaining documentation. Consider setting the file name to a more descriptive value, such as `OoBDev.System.Common.Abstractions.xml`.

Suggested change:
```xml
<GenerateDocumentationFile>True</GenerateDocumentationFile>
<DocumentationFile>Documentation.xml</DocumentationFile>
```
**Readme(System.Abstractions).md**

1. **Summary**: The summary is brief and to the point, highlighting the purpose of the library. Consider adding more details about the key features, APIs, and use cases.

Suggested change:
```markdown
