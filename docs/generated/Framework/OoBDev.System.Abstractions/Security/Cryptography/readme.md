**README**

This repository contains a set of files related to cryptographic hash generation. The core functionality is described below.

**Summary**

The system provides a simple interface for generating cryptographic hashes from input values. This is achieved through an abstract interface `IHash` that defines a single method `GetHash`, which takes a string value as input and returns a hashed representation of that value.

**Technical Summary**

The system utilizes a Facade design pattern, where the `IHash` interface acts as a simple wrapper for a more complex hashing algorithm. This allows for a clean and easy-to-use interface for clients to generate hashes, while hiding the underlying implementation details.

@startuml
class IHash {
    +string GetHash(string value)
}

class HashGenerator {
    -algorithm: string
    -salt: string

    +string GenerateHash(string value) {
        return algorithm + salt + value;
    }
}
