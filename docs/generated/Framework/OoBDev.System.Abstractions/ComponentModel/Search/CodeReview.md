A very interesting codebase! As a senior software engineer/solutions architect, I've reviewed the code and will provide suggestions for improvements in coding patterns, methods, structure, and classes to make the code more maintainable.

**General Observations**

1. The code is quite concise, which is a good thing, but it also means that some parts might be hard to understand without proper comments and documentation.
2. The naming conventions are mostly consistent, but there are some minor variations (e.g., `TargetName` in some classes has a `?` suffix, while in others it doesn't).
3. The code uses attributes to decorate classes and properties, which is a good approach for metadata-driven programming.

**Specific Suggestions**

**DefaultSortAttribute.cs**

1. Consider adding a non-public constructor that takes only the required parameters, to prevent accidental initialization with default values.
2. The `Priority` and `Order` properties have default values. You might consider making them `readonly` or immutable to ensure their values are set only once.

**FilterableAttribute.cs**

1. You could add a `get_` accessor to the `TargetName` property to make it clear that it's an immutable property.
2. Consider adding a method to the `FilterableAttribute` class to check if a given property or class is filterable, to simplify usage.

**IgnoreStringComparisonReplacementAttribute.cs**

1. This attribute is quite simple and could be removed if the functionality can be achieved through other means (e.g., a strategy pattern).

**ISearchQueryIntercept.cs**

1. The interface is quite coarse-grained; consider breaking it down into smaller, more specific interfaces for different types of search queries or interceptors.
2. The `Intercept` method returns an `ISearchQuery` instance. You might consider using an `ISearchQuery` builder or a factory method to create new instances.

**NotFilterableAttribute.cs**

1. Similar to `FilterableAttribute`, consider adding a method to check if a given property or class is not filterable.
2. Consider making the `TargetName` property optional (by adding a default value or using a nullable string) to simplify usage.

**Additional Suggestions**

1. Consider creating an abstract base class or an interface for attributes that share common functionality, such as `TargetName` handling.
2. You might want to consider using a more formal approach for naming conventions, such as following the .NET Framework Design Guidelines.
3. If the codebase will be extensive and has multiple modules or projects, consider using a solution-wide namespace for the attributes and other definitions.

Overall, the code is well-structured and easy to follow, and the suggestions I provided should help improve its maintainability and reusability.
