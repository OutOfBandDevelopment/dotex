**Readme File**

This repository contains a set of C# classes and interfaces that provide a foundation for representing query results in a system. The main components include:

1. `IResult`: An interface that represents a query result, which may include a collection of messages.
2. `MessageLevels`: An enum that defines various levels of response messages, such as Trace, Debug, Information, Warning, Error, Critical, and None.
3. `ModelResult<TModel>`: A class that represents a result containing a single model, with optional messages.
4. `PagedQueryResult<TModel>`: A class that represents the result of a paged query, including information about the current page, total page count, total row count, and a collection of items.
5. `QueryResult<TModel>`: A class that represents the result of a query operation, containing a collection of items and optional result messages.

**Technical Summary**

The design pattern used in this repository is the **Repository Pattern**, which encapsulates the data access and business logic for retrieving and manipulating data. This pattern helps to decouple the data access logic from the presentation layer and reduces complexity.

Additionally, the classes and interfaces follow **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**, as each component has a single responsibility and is designed to perform a specific task.

  - Rows: IEnumerable<TModel>

  - Rows: IReadOnlyCollection<TModel>
  - Messages: IReadOnlyCollection<ResultMessage>
}

In this diagram, we can see the relationships between the classes and interfaces. Each class or interface is represented by a box, while the arrows represent the relationships between them. The `IResult` interface is the base interface that all query result classes implement. The `MessageLevels` enum is used to provide a range of possible message levels. The `ModelResult`, `PagedQueryResult`, and `QueryResult` classes are the main components that implement the query result logic.
