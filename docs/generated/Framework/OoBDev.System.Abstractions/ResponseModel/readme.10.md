**Summary**

The provided source files are part of a system responsible for handling responses and providing detailed information about issues. The `ResultMessage` class contains properties that define the importance level, message, message code, context, and additional metadata related to the response.

**Technical Summary**

The `ResultMessage` class utilizes the Record class in C# to define a data structure that represents a response message. It follows the Builder pattern, where the properties are initialized with default values and can be overridden when creating a new instance.

**Component Diagram**

```plantuml
@startuml
class ResultMessage {
  - level: MessageLevels
  - message: string
  - messageCode: string
  - context: string
  - metaData: object
}

note "Response System"
ResultMessage -->> MessageLevels

@enduml
```

In this component diagram, `ResultMessage` is a class that contains properties to represent the response message. The `MessageLevels` class is not explicitly shown, as it is not provided in the source files. However, it can be inferred to be a separate class or enum that defines the importance level related to the response.
