**Summary**

This repository provides a set of functionality for search and filtering of data. The main components are:

1. `ISearchTermQuery`: Represents a query object that includes a search term for filtering data.
2. `ISortBuilder`: Represents an interface for building sorting expressions and applying sorting to a query.
3. `ISortQuery`: Represents an interface for specifying sorting criteria in a query.
4. `OrderDirections`: Enumeration to control sort order.

**Technical Summary**

The system uses a combination of design patterns and architectural patterns to achieve its functionality.

* **Dependency Injection**: The system uses interfaces and dependency injection to decouple components and make them loosely coupled.
* **Strategy Pattern**: The `ISortBuilder` interface uses the strategy pattern to allow different sorting algorithms to be used.
* **Factory Pattern**: The `OrderDirections` enumeration uses the factory pattern to create instances of the enumeration.
* **MVC Pattern**: The system uses the MVC pattern to separate concerns and make the code more maintainable.

**Component Diagram**

```
```plantuml

class ISearchTermQuery {
    - SearchTerm: string?
}
class ISortBuilder {
    - SortBy(query, searchRequest, treeBuilder, stringComparison): IOrderedQueryable
}
class ISortQuery {
    - OrderBy: IDictionary
}
class OrderDirections {
    - Ascending
    - Descending
}
class OrderDirectionsConstants {
    - Ascending
    - Descending
}

This component diagram shows the relationships between the classes and interfaces in the system. It illustrates how the `ISearchTermQuery` interface relates to the `ISortBuilder` interface, and how the `ISortBuilder` interface relates to the `ISortQuery` interface and the `OrderDirections` enumeration.
