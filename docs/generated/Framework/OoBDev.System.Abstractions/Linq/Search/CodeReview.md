As a senior software engineer and solutions architect, I will review each file individually and suggest changes to improve maintainability.

**FilterParameter.cs**

* The `FilterParameter` class is a good example of a strongly-typed object that represents a filter condition in a search query. The use of `record` is a good approach to reduce boilerplate code.
* However, there are a few issues:
	+ The `ToString()` method is implemented as a string builder concatenation. This is not a good approach, as it makes the code harder to understand and maintain. Instead, consider creating a separate `FilterParameterString` class that can be used to generate a string representation of the filter parameter.
	+ The `Ors` and `Ands` properties are commented out, which implies they might not be needed. However, if they are indeed not needed, it would be good to remove the commented code to avoid confusion.
	+ The `OrNull` property is not used anywhere, and it looks like it might not be needed. Consider removing it.

**Proposed changes:**

* Create a `FilterParameterString` class to generate a string representation of the filter parameter.
* Remove the commented-out `Ors` and `Ands` properties.
* Remove the `OrNull` property if it's not needed.

**IFilterQuery.cs**

* This interface defines a simple CRUD operation for filter parameters. However, it's unclear how the `Filter` property would be populated with filter parameters.
* Consider adding additional methods to this interface to support more advanced filtering operations, such as filtering by multiple properties or using logical operators.

**Proposed changes:**

* Add additional methods to support more advanced filtering operations.

**IPageQuery.cs**

* This interface defines a simple pagination query. However, the `ExcludePageCount` property is not clearly defined.
* Consider adding a comment or a brief description to explain what this property is used for.

**Proposed changes:**

* Add a comment or brief description to explain the `ExcludePageCount` property.

**IQueryBuilder.cs**

* This interface defines a query builder that takes an `IQueryable` and an `ISearchQuery` as input.
* The `ExecuteBy` method is missing a return type. Consider adding `IQueryResult` as the return type.
* The interface has two versions, `IQueryBuilder` and `IQueryBuilder<TModel>`. Consider merging these into a single interface with a type parameter.

**Proposed changes:**

* Add a return type to the `ExecuteBy` method.
* Merge the two interfaces into a single interface with a type parameter.

**ISearchQuery.cs**

* This interface defines a search query that combines page, sort, search term, and filter criteria.
* The interface has two versions, `ISearchQuery` and `ISearchQuery<TModel>`. Consider merging these into a single interface with a type parameter.

**Proposed changes:**

* Merge the two interfaces into a single interface with a type parameter.

Overall, the code has some good design principles, such as using interfaces and records. However, there are some areas where the code can be improved to make it more maintainable, such as reducing complexity in the `FilterParameter` class, adding more advanced filtering operations to `IFilterQuery`, and merging duplicate interfaces.
