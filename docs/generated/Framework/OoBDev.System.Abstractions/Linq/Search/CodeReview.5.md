As a senior software engineer/solutions architect, I'll review the code and suggest changes to improve maintainability.

**ISearchTermQuery.cs**

1. Consider removing the nullable annotation from the `SearchTerm` property, as it's not clear why it's necessary. If it's indeed nullable, consider adding a reasonable default value or documenting the nullability constraints.
2. The interface name is descriptive, but the summary could be more specific and concise. For example, "Represents a search query with a searchable term."

**ISortBuilder.cs**

1. The method `SortBy` is quite complex and does multiple tasks. Consider breaking it down into smaller methods, each with a single responsibility. This would improve readability and testability.
2. The `searchRequest` parameter is not a good name; consider something more specific like `sortCriteria`.
3. The `stringComparison` parameter is not used anywhere; consider removing it or documenting its intended use.

**ISortQuery.cs**

1. The `OrderBy` dictionary property has a mismatched type. Consider making it `IDictionary<string, OrderDirections>` instead of `IDictionary<string, OrderDirections>`.
2. Consider adding a public constructor to ensure the dictionary is initialized correctly.

**OrderDirections.cs**

1. The enum values use magic numbers (0 and 1) instead of named constants. Consider using a separate class (like `OrderDirectionsConstants`) to define these constants.
2. The `JsonConverter` attribute is used to customize JSON serialization. Consider moving it to a separate class or using a more robust serialization approach.

**OrderDirectionsConstants.cs**

1. This class seems to be a simple mapping of string constants to enum values. Consider making it an enumeration class (e.g., `public enum OrderDirectionsConstants`) to avoid the need for a separate class.

**Suggestions**

1. Extract shared logic and concepts into separate classes to reduce coupling and improve reuse.
2. Consider using Dependency Injection (DI) to inject dependencies like `IExpressionTreeBuilder` and `StringComparison` instead of relying on constructor parameters.
3. Implement interface segregation principle (ISP) to ensure that interfaces are not too broad or complex. For example, separate interfaces for sorting and filtering.
4. Use descriptive names and avoid abbreviations (e.g., `ISortQuery` could become `ISortCriteriaQuery`).
5. Document the code thoroughly, especially for interfaces and abstract classes.

Here's a revised code structure to improve maintainability:
```csharp
// OoBDev.System.Linq.Search

public interface ISortQuery
{
    // ...
}

public interface ISortQueryProvider : ISortQuery
{
    void Sort(IQueryable<TModel> query, ISortCriteria sortCriteria);
}

// OoBDev.System.Linq.Search.Sorting

public interface ISortingService
{
    IOrderedQueryable<TModel> Sort(IQueryable<TModel> query, ISortQuery sortQuery);
}

public class SortingService : ISortingService
{
    private readonly IExpressionTreeBuilder<TModel> _treeBuilder;

    public SortingService(IExpressionTreeBuilder<TModel> treeBuilder)
    {
        _treeBuilder = treeBuilder;
    }

    public IOrderedQueryable<TModel> Sort(IQueryable<TModel> query, ISortQuery sortQuery)
    {
        // Implement sorting logic
    }
}

// OoBDev.System.Linq.Search.Expressions

public interface IExpressionTreeBuilder<TModel>
{
    // ...
}

public class ExpressionTreeBuilder : IExpressionTreeBuilder<TModel>
{
    // Implement expression building logic
}
```
This revised structure separates concerns and provides a clear separation of responsibilities. The `ISortingService` interface encapsulates the sorting logic, while the `SortingService` class implements it. The `ISortQueryProvider` interface provides a way to create a new sort query.
