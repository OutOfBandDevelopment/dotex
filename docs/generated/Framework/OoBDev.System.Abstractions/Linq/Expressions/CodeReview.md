As a senior software engineer/solutions architect, I'll provide a review of the given source code and suggest changes to improve its maintainability.

**IExpressionTreeBuilder.cs**

1. The `IExpressionTreeBuilder` interface should be split into two separate interfaces: `IExpressionTreeBuilder` and `ITypedExpressionTreeBuilder`. This will allow for a better separation of concerns and make the code more flexible.
2. The methods `GetSearchablePropertyNames`, `GetSortablePropertyNames`, and `GetFilterablePropertyNames` seem to be related to metadata retrieval. Consider creating a separate interface `IPropertyMetadataProvider` for this purpose.
3. The `DefaultSortOrder` method can be moved to `IPropertyMetadataProvider` as well, since it's also related to metadata.
4. Consider adding a `GetPropertyNameresolver` method to `IExpressionTreeBuilder` to handle property name resolution.
5. The interface seems to lack a `BuildExpressionTree` method, which is essential for constructing expression trees. Add this method to the interface.

**IExpressionTreeBuilder<TModel>.cs**

1. The `IExpressionTreeBuilder<TModel>` interface can be further divided into two parts: one for building predicates and the other for building expression trees. This will make the code more modular and easier to maintain.
2. The `GetPredicateExpression` method should be renamed to something more descriptive, such as `GetFilterExpression`.
3. Consider adding overloads for `BuildExpression` and `GetPredicateExpression` to handle different types of query parameters (e.g., `Guid`, `int`, etc.).
4. The `PropertyExpressions` method seems to return a dictionary of property names and expression trees. Consider renaming it to `GetPropertyExpressions` or `GetPropertyExpressionsDictionary`.

**IPostBuildExpressionVisitor.cs**

1. The interface `IPostBuildExpressionVisitor` is quite straightforward, but you might consider adding a `VisitExpressions` method that visits an entire expression tree, not just a single node.

**Suggestions for Improvements**

1. Consider using extension methods instead of explicit interface implementations for some methods (e.g., `GetPredicateExpression`).
2. Review the usage of `IReadOnlyCollection` and `IReadOnlyDictionary` interfaces. Are they really necessary, or can you use more efficient collection types (e.g., `List<T>`)?
3. Think about implementing the builder pattern to create instances of `IExpressionTreeBuilder` and `IPostBuildExpressionVisitor`.
4. Document the interfaces and classes with XML comments to provide a clear understanding of their purpose and usage.

**Refactored Code**

```C#
public interface IExpressionTreeBuilder
{
    // Methods for metadata retrieval
    IReadOnlyCollection<string> GetSearchablePropertyNames();
    // ...

    // Method for building expression trees
    Expression<Func<TModel, bool>> BuildExpressionTree<TModel>(TModel queryParameter);

    // Resolves property names
    string GetPropertyName<TModel>(Expression<Func<TModel, object>> propertyAccessor);
}

public interface IPropertyMetadataProvider
{
    IReadOnlyCollection<string> GetSearchablePropertyNames();
    // ...
}

public interface IExpressionTreeBuilder<TModel> : IExpressionTreeBuilder
{
    // Methods for building filters and predicates
    Expression<Func<TModel, bool>> GetFilterExpression<TModel>(string name, FilterParameter value, StringComparison stringComparison, bool isSearchTerm);

    // Methods for building expression trees
    Expression<Func<TModel, bool>> BuildExpressionTree<TModel>(TModel queryParameter, StringComparison stringComparison, bool isSearchTerm);
}
```

By addressing these concerns and suggestions, the code will become more maintainable, flexible, and easier to evolve.
