**Readme File**

This repository contains two interfaces for building and processing expression trees. The `IExpressionTreeBuilder` interface provides a way to construct expression trees for querying and filtering, while the `IPostBuildExpressionVisitor` interface allows for post-processing of the expression tree after it has been built.

**Summary**

The `IExpressionTreeBuilder` interface provides a set of methods for building expression trees that can be used for querying and filtering data. It includes methods for getting the names of searchable, sortable, and filterable properties, as well as methods for building predicate expressions and expression trees based on query parameters.

The `IPostBuildExpressionVisitor` interface provides a way to customize the behavior of the expression tree after it has been built. It includes a single method that allows for visiting and modifying expression nodes.

**Technical Summary**

The `IExpressionTreeBuilder` interface uses an architectural pattern known as the "Builder" pattern, which provides a way to construct complex objects step-by-step. This allows for a more flexible and maintainable approach to building expression trees.

The `IPostBuildExpressionVisitor` interface uses a design pattern known as the "Visitor" pattern, which provides a way to perform operations on objects without modifying their internal state. This allows for a more modular and reusable approach to post-processing expression trees.

This component diagram shows the relationships between the `IExpressionTreeBuilder` interface, the `IExpressionTreeBuilder<TModel>` interface, and the `IPostBuildExpressionVisitor` interface. The `IExpressionTreeBuilder` interface provides a base set of methods for building expression trees, while the `IExpressionTreeBuilder<TModel>` interface provides a more specific set of methods for building expression trees for a particular type of model. The `IPostBuildExpressionVisitor` interface provides a way to customize the behavior of the expression tree after it has been built.
