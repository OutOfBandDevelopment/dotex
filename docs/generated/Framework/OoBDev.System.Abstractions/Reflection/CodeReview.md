As a senior software engineer and solutions architect, I'll review the provided source code and suggest changes to coding patterns, methods, structure, and classes to make it more maintainable.

**EnumExtensions.cs**

1. **FirstName**: The `First` method is not thread-safe and can throw a `NullReferenceException` if any of the provided values are null. Consider using `FirstOrDefault` or creating a generic method to handle this case.
2. **ToString**: The `ToString` method in `EnumModel` is complex and can be improved by using the `string.Format` method or a dedicated `ToString` logic.
3. **AsModel**: The `AsModel` method returns `null` if the `enumName` is null. Consider throwing a `NullReferenceException` instead to indicate a failure.
4. **AsModels**: The `AsModels` method returns an `IReadOnlyCollection<IEnumModel>`. Consider using a generic method to create a collection of `IEnumModel<TEnum>` instead.

**EnumModel.cs**

1. **Required properties**: The `Name`, `Code`, and `Description` properties are marked as required, but the constructor does not enforce this check. Consider using a validation library or a custom validation mechanism.
2. **EnumModel<TEnum>**: The generic record `EnumModel<TEnum>` has a redundant `Value` property with the same type as the `Value` property in the base class. Consider removing the redundant property or making it an indexer.

**IEnumModel.cs**

1. **Interface naming**: The interface names (`IEnumModel` and `IEnumModel<TEnum>`) are similar, which could lead to confusion. Consider renaming the interfaces to `IEnumValue` and `IEnumValue<TEnum>` respectively.
2. **Properties**: The `Value` property in `IEnumModel` is of type `object`, which may not be suitable for all enum types. Consider making it a generic property of type `TEnum` in `IEnumModel<TEnum>`.

**IResolveType.cs**

1. **Method name**: The method `ResolveType` is not descriptive. Consider renaming it to something like `GetResolvedType`.

**Recommended changes**

1. **Convert `EnumExtensions` to a generic class**: Instead of having a generic method `ToEnum<TEnum>`, consider converting the entire `EnumExtensions` class to a generic class `EnumExtensions<TEnum>`. This would allow for more type-safe methods and avoid method overloading.
2. **Use type-safe methods**: In `EnumExtensions`, use type-safe methods instead of relying on reflection. For example, you can use `Enum.GetValues` and `Enum.GetName` to get the enumeration values and names.
3. **Simplify `AsModel`**: Consider simplifying the `AsModel` method by using a single LINQ query to retrieve the necessary attributes and property values.
4. **Use a separate class for parsing**: The `ToEnum` method in `EnumExtensions` is responsible for both parsing and converting. Consider creating a separate class `EnumParser` to handle parsing and converting separately.
5. **Use a validation library**: Consider using a validation library like FluentValidation or ValidateNet to handle validation and ensure that the `EnumModel` properties are valid.

By implementing these changes, you can make the code more maintainable, readable, and efficient.
