**README FILE**

**Summary**
The `IAccessor.cs` file defines an interface `IAccessor<T>` that allows for an instance to be bound to an asynchronous context. This interface provides a way to access and set a value of type `T` while keeping track of the context in which the instance is being used.

**Technical Summary**
The `IAccessor<T>` interface is an example of the **Factory Pattern**, where an object responsible for creating instances of a class is decoupled from the class itself. The interface defines a method `Value` that allows for getting and setting a value of type `T`, and is designed to be used in an asynchronous context.
