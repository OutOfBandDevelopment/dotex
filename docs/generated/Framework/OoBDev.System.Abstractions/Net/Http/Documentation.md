# Correlation and Tracking Information

## CorrelationInfo Class

The `CorrelationInfo` class represents information related to correlation and tracking in a system. It contains two properties: `CorrelationId` and `RequestId`.

### CorrelationId

The `CorrelationId` property gets or sets the correlation identifier. This identifier is used to associate related operations or events across different components or services.

### RequestId

The `RequestId` property gets or sets the request identifier. This identifier is used to uniquely identify a specific request or operation within a system.

```plantuml
class CorrelationInfo {
    CorrelationId: string?
    RequestId: string?
}
```

## DefinedHttpHeaders Class

The `DefinedHttpHeaders` class contains constant values for commonly used HTTP headers.

### CorrelationIdHeader

The `CorrelationIdHeader` constant represents the "X-Correlation-ID" HTTP header used for correlation identification.

### RequestIdHeader

The `RequestIdHeader` constant represents the "X-Request-ID" HTTP header used for request identification.

### AcceptLanguage

The `AcceptLanguage` constant represents the "Accept-Language" HTTP header used for specifying acceptable languages for the response.

### ContentLanguage

The `ContentLanguage` constant represents the "Content-Language" HTTP header used for specifying the language of the content.

```plantuml
class DefinedHttpHeaders {
    CorrelationIdHeader: string
    RequestIdHeader: string
    AcceptLanguage: string
    ContentLanguage: string
}
```

Note: The above PlantUML code will generate a class diagram showing the classes and their properties.

Component Model:

The component model for this system can be represented as follows:

```plantuml
@startuml
component OoBDev.System.Net.Http {
  CorrelationInfo
  DefinedHttpHeaders
}
@enduml
```

This component model shows the `OoBDev.System.Net.Http` namespace as a component that contains the `CorrelationInfo` and `DefinedHttpHeaders` classes.

Sequence Diagram:

The sequence diagram for this system can be represented as follows:

```plantuml
@startuml
activatingLifeLine client
autonumber "Request"
activate client
    message "Send HTTP Request"
    alt "Request contains CorrelationId" {
        message "Set CorrelationIdHeader"
    }
    else {
        message "No CorrelationIdHeader"
    }
    deactivate client
@enduml
```

This sequence diagram shows a client sending an HTTP request that may contain a correlation identifier. If the request contains a correlation identifier, the system sets the `CorrelationIdHeader` and sends the response. Otherwise, it does not set the `CorrelationIdHeader`.
