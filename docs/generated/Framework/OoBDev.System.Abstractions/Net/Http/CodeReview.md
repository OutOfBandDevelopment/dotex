As a senior software engineer/solutions architect, I'll review the code and suggest changes to improve maintainability, structure, and class design.

**CorrelationInfo.cs**

The `CorrelationInfo` class is a simple data container with two properties: `CorrelationId` and `RequestId`. While it serves its purpose, there are a few suggestions to improve maintainability and usability:

1. **Consider making the properties immutable**: Since the properties are only getters without setters, it would be beneficial to make them immutable. This can be achieved by using a constructor with parameters to initialize the properties and marking the setters as private or internal.
2. **Consider adding validation for the properties**: In a real-world scenario, it's essential to validate the input data to prevent potential issues. You can add validation attributes or implement custom validation logic to ensure the properties contain valid data.
3. **Consider adding a default constructor**: Although the class is designed to be used with the constructor, it's a good practice to provide a default constructor (parameterless) for scenarios where the properties are not initialized explicitly.

**DefinedHttpHeaders.cs**

The `DefinedHttpHeaders` class contains a set of constant values for commonly used HTTP headers. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Consider making the class non-static**: Since the constants are not going to change, making the class non-static can allow you to decouple the constant values from the class itself. You can create a static constructor to populate the constants.
2. **Consider grouping related headers together**: The class contains a mix of correlation, request identification, and language-related headers. It might be more organized to group related headers together, such as `CorrelationHeaders` and `LanguageHeaders`.
3. **Consider using an `enum` for the headers**: If the number of headers grows, it might be more manageable to define an `enum` for the headers, which can simplify the code and make it easier to maintain.

**Suggested changes**

Here's an updated version of the code incorporating the suggested changes:

**CorrelationInfo.cs**
```csharp
namespace OoBDev.System.Net.Http;

public class CorrelationInfo
{
    public CorrelationInfo(string correlationId, string? requestId = null)
    {
        CorrelationId = correlationId;
        RequestId = requestId;
    }

    public string CorrelationId { get; private set; }

    public string? RequestId { get; private set; }
}
```

**DefinedHttpHeaders.cs**
```csharp
namespace OoBDev.System.Net.Http;

public class HttpHeaders
{
    private static HttpHeaders()
    {
        CorrelationHeaders = new Dictionary<string, string>
        {
            { "X-Correlation-ID", "X-Correlation-ID" },
            { "X-Request-ID", "X-Request-ID" }
        };

        LanguageHeaders = new Dictionary<string, string>
        {
            { "Accept-Language", "Accept-Language" },
            { "Content-Language", "Content-Language" }
        };
    }

    public static readonly Dictionary<string, string> CorrelationHeaders { get; }

    public static readonly Dictionary<string, string> LanguageHeaders { get; }
}
```

The changes aim to make the code more maintainable, organized, and flexible. The `CorrelationInfo` class is now immutable, and the `DefinedHttpHeaders` class is no longer static, making it easier to work with. Additionally, the constants are grouped into dictionaries to simplify the code and make it more organized.
