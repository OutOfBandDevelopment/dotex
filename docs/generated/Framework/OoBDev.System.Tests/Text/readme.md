**README File**

This repository contains a unit test suite for the `SerializerSelector` class, which is part of a larger system for serializing and deserializing data. The test suite covers both default serialization and keyed serialization, and includes tests for various serializer types (JSON, BSON, XML).

**Summary**

The `SerializerSelector` class allows for the selection of a serializer based on various criteria, including the type of serialization desired (e.g. JSON, BSON, XML) and the type of data being serialized. The class uses a combination of dependency injection and configuration to determine which serializer to use for a given scenario. The unit tests provided in this repository exercise the functionality of the `SerializerSelector` class, verifying that it correctly selects and returns the desired serializer.

**Technical Summary**

The design and architectural patterns used in this codebase include:

* Implementation of the **Factory Pattern**, where the `SerializerSelector` class acts as a factory for creating serializer instances based on user configuration and selection.
* Use of **Dependency Injection**, where the `SerializerSelector` class depends on an instance of `ISerializer` to actually perform the serialization and deserialization.
* **Configuration-driven selection**, where the selection of a serializer is determined by configuration settings rather than hardcoded logic.

**Component Diagram**

Here is a component diagram for the `SerializerSelector` class, generated using PlantUML:
```
```plantuml

class SerializerSelector {
  - ISerializer serializer
  + ISerializer SelectSerializer(SerializerTypes serializerType)
}

class ISerializer {
  + Serialize(object data)
  + Deserialize(object data)
}

class Configuration {
  - ConfigurationData data
  + GetSerializerType()
}

class ConfigurationData {
  - serializerType
}

class ServiceCollection {
  + TryAddSystemExtensions(Configuration config)
  + BuildServiceProvider()
}
