**Code Review**

I'll focus on suggesting changes to improve the code's maintainability, scalability, and overall quality.

**1. Class Structure and Organization**

The class has a lot of methods, many of which are testing methods. It would be beneficial to separate these testing methods into their own classes or categories to keep the main class organized and focused on its primary responsibilities.

**2. Naming and Code Readability**

Some method names, such as `ExecuteByTest_Filter` and `ExecuteByTest_Page`, are not descriptive and could be improved. Additionally, there are many nesting levels in the code, which can make it harder to read and understand. Consider flattening the code structure or using more descriptive method names to improve readability.

**3. Code Duplication**

The code has several instances of similar logic, such as creating a `SearchQuery` object and executing the query. Consider extracting this logic into a separate method or class to reduce code duplication.

**4. Type Handling and Generics**

The code uses a lot of type casting and reflection, which can be error-prone and slow. Consider using generics and type-safe methods to improve the code's maintainability and performance.

**5. Error Handling**

There is no explicit error handling in the code. It's important to add try-catch blocks to handle exceptions and provide meaningful error messages.

**6. Code Quality**

Some code sections, such as the `ExecuteByTest_Filter_JsonElement` method, are not easily testable or maintainable due to the lack of abstraction. Consider refactoring these sections to make them more modular and testable.

**7. Test Data Generation**

The `TestDataBuilder` class generates test data using reflection. This can lead to performance issues and complexity. Consider using a more lightweight and efficient way to generate test data.

**8. Dependency Injection**

The code has hard-coded dependencies, such as `TestContext` and `QueryBuilder`. Consider using dependency injection to decouple the classes and make them more testable.

**9. Database Integration**

The code seems to be integrating with a database, but it's not clear how this integration is happening. Consider using a dependency injection framework to manage the database connection and queries.

**Suggestions**

1. Extract testing methods into separate classes or categories.
2. Improve method naming and code readability.
3. Extract common logic into separate methods or classes.
4. Use generics and type-safe methods.
5. Add explicit error handling.
6. Refactor code sections to make them more modular and testable.
7. Generate test data using a more lightweight and efficient approach.
8. Use dependency injection to decouple classes.
9. Consider using a dependency injection framework for database integration.

These suggestions should improve the maintainability, scalability, and overall quality of the code.
