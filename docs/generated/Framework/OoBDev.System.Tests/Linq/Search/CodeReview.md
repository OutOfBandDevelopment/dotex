**Overall Assessment**

The provided code is a test case for the `QueryBuilder` class, which is responsible for constructing and executing queries on data. The code appears to be well-structured, with clear separations between setup, test execution, and assertions. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to increase maintainability and scalability.

**Suggestions for Improvement**

1. **Extract Methods**:
	* Extract the query setup logic into separate methods, such as `SetupQuery()` or `CreateSearchQuery()`. This will make the code easier to read and test.
	* Extract the mocking setup logic into separate methods, such as `SetupMockSortBuilder()` or `SetupMockExpressionBuilder()`. This will make the code more modular and easier to test.
2. **Reduce Coupling**:
	* The `QueryBuilderTests` class has tight coupling with multiple classes (e.g., `SearchQuery`, `ISortBuilder`, `IExpressionTreeBuilder`). Consider introducing interfaces or abstractions to decouple the classes.
	* Additionally, the `QueryBuilder` class has a direct dependency on `Logger` and `CaptureResultMessage`. Consider injecting these dependencies through constructors or repositories.
3. **Simplify Mocking**:
	* Instead of using `MockRepository` to create mock objects, consider using `Moq` framework's fluent API to define mock behavior. This will provide more flexibility and readability.
	* Simplify the mocking setup logic by using `It.IsAny<T>()` and `It.IsAny<ArgumentException>()` instead of hardcoding values.
4. **Consistent Naming**:
	* Consistency in naming conventions is crucial for maintainability. Ensure that all method names, variable names, and class names follow the same naming convention (e.g., PascalCase or CambrianCase).
5. **Code Organization**:
	* Break down the large `QueryBuilderTests` class into smaller, more focused test classes. This will make the code easier to read and maintain.
	* Consider creating a separate class for query setup and execution, allowing the `QueryBuilderTests` class to focus solely on testing the `QueryBuilder` class.
6. **Error Handling**:
	* The `QueryBuilder` class and its dependencies do not appear to have any error handling mechanisms. Consider introducing try-catch blocks and error handling strategies to ensure the code can handle unexpected situations.
7. **Code Comments**:
	* Add comments to explain the purpose of each method, class, and test. This will aid understanding and reduce the learning curve for new developers.

**Proposed Changes**

Here is a proposed version of the `QueryBuilderTests` class incorporating the suggested improvements:
```csharp
[TestClass]
public class QueryBuilderTests
{
    private readonly ITestContext _testContext;
    private readonly ISearchQuery _searchQuery;

    public QueryBuilderTests() : this(new TestContext()) { }
    public QueryBuilderTests(ITestContext testContext)
    {
        _testContext = testContext;
        _searchQuery = CreateSearchQuery();
    }

    [TestMethod]
    [TestCategory(TestCategories.Unit)]
    public void ExecuteByTest_IQueryable()
    {
        // Setup
        var queryable = TestDataBuilder.GetTestData(typeof(TestTargetModel), 0);
        var sortBySetup = SetupMockSortBuilder();
        var expressionBuilderSetup = SetupMockExpressionBuilder();

        // Mock
        var sortBuilderMock = sortBySetup.GetSortBuilderMock();
        var expressionBuilderMock = expressionBuilderSetup.GetExpressionBuilderMock();

        // Test
        var queryBuilder = new QueryBuilder<TestTargetModel>(sortBuilderMock, expressionBuilderMock, ...);
        var result = queryBuilder.ExecuteBy(queryable, _searchQuery);

        // Assert
        Assert.IsNotNull(result);
    }

    private ISearchQuery CreateSearchQuery()
    {
        // Return a sample search query
    }

    private ISortBuilderMock SetupMockSortBuilder()
    {
        // Return a mock sort builder setup
    }

    private IExpressionBuilderMock SetupMockExpressionBuilder()
    {
        // Return a mock expression builder setup
    }
}
```
Note that this is just a proposed version, and actual changes will depend on the specific requirements and constraints of the project.
