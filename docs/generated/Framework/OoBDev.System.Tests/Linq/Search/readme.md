Here is the README file with a summary, technical summary, and component diagram:

**README**

**Summary**
The QueryBuilderTests.cs file contains unit tests for the QueryBuilder class in OoBDev.System.Linq.Search. The tests cover scenarios where the QueryBuilder executes a query, sorting and filtering data, and capturing results.

**Technical Summary**
The QueryBuilderTests.cs file employs several design patterns and architectural patterns:

* **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: The file contains unit tests for the QueryBuilder class, ensuring that it behaves as expected.
* **Dependency Injection**: The QueryBuilder class takes in dependencies such as `ISortBuilder`, `IExpressionTreeBuilder`, and `IPostBuildExpressionVisitor` through its constructor.
* **Interface-based programming**: The file uses interfaces such as `ISortBuilder`, `IExpressionTreeBuilder`, and `IPostBuildExpressionVisitor` to define the contracts that the QueryBuilder class depends on.
* **Mocking**: The file uses Moq to create mock objects for the dependencies, allowing for more controlled and predictable testing scenarios.

@startuml
class QueryBuilder {
  -ISortBuilder sortBuilder
  -IExpressionTreeBuilder expressionBuilder
  -IPostBuildExpressionVisitor[] postBuildVisitors
  -ILogger logger
  -CaptureResultMessage capture
}

class ISortBuilder {
  +SortBy(IQueryable<T>, ISortQuery, IExpressionTreeBuilder<T>, StringComparison)
}

class IExpressionTreeBuilder<T> {
  +BuildExpression(object, StringComparison, bool)
  +GetPredicateExpression(string, FilterParameter, StringComparison, bool)
}

class IPostBuildExpressionVisitor {
  +VisitExpression(Expression)
}

class Logger {
  +CreateLogger<T>()
}

class CaptureResultMessage {
  +Capture()
  +GetCapture()
}

Note: The component diagram shows the main classes and interfaces involved in the QueryBuilderTests.cs file, as well as their relationships.
