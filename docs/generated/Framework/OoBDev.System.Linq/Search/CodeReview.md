As a senior software engineer/scientist, I'll provide you with a comprehensive review of the provided code, including suggestions for improvement.

**Code Organization and Structure**

1. The code is well-organized, with distinct classes and methods for specific tasks. However, some classes (e.g., `QueryBuilder`, `SortBuilder`) have multiple responsibilities. Consider refactoring to separate concerns and minimize coupling.
2. The `OperatorExtensions` class contains multiple extension methods for converting operators to filter parameters. This could be split into separate classes or helper methods to improve cohesion and readability.
3. The `QueryBuilder` class is quite extensive, containing multiple methods for building and executing queries. Consider breaking it down into smaller, more focused classes or base classes.

**Method Signatures and Usability**

1. The `Execute` methods in `QueryBuilder` have many parameters. Consider providing overload(s) with meaningful default values to simplify usage.
2. The `BuildFrom` method in `QueryBuilder` takes multiple parameters. Consider creating separate methods for each step in the query building process (e.g., searching, filtering, sorting) to make the process more digestible.
3. The `SortBy` method in `SortBuilder` has a long list of parameters. Consider providing an overload with meaningful default values or simplifying the method signature using optional parameters.

**Logging and Error Handling**

1. The code uses `ILogger` for logging, which is a good practice. However, consider implementing logging at a more granular level (e.g., using `ILogger` instances per method or class) to provide more specific context.
2. Error handling is minimal in the code. Consider implementing more robust error handling mechanisms (e.g., using try-catch blocks, exception filters, or more advanced error handling frameworks) to ensure the application remains stable.

**Code Quality and Readability**

1. The code uses meaningful variable and method names, which makes it easier to understand.
2. However, some methods (e.g., `BuildFrom`, `SortBy`) are quite long and complex. Consider breaking them down into smaller, more focused methods to improve readability and maintainability.
3. The code contains some hardcoded values (e.g., `DefaultPageSize`, `stringComparison`). Consider replacing these with configurable constants or settings to make the application more flexible.

**Suggestions for Improvement**

1. Consider creating a separate class for query building and execution to improve cohesion.
2. Implement more robust error handling mechanisms to ensure the application remains stable.
3. Simplify method signatures and usages by providing overload(s) with meaningful default values.
4. Break down complex methods (e.g., `BuildFrom`, `SortBy`) into smaller, more focused methods to improve readability and maintainability.
5. Improve logging at a more granular level using `ILogger` instances per method or class.

**Code Review Conclusion**

Overall, the code is well-organized, and the maintainability is decent. However, there are areas for improvement, such as refactoring to separate concerns, simplifying method signatures, and implementing more robust error handling mechanisms.
