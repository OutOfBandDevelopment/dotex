Overall, the code is well-structured and follows a consistent naming convention. However, there are some areas that can be improved for maintainability, scalability, and readability:

1. **Separate Concerns**: The `ExpressionTreeBuilder` class is doing too many things. It's responsible for building expressions, getting properties, and searching for predicates. Consider breaking it down into smaller classes or at least different methods.
2. **Comments and Documentation**: While there are some comments, there's a lack of documentation throughout the code. Consider adding XML comments to explain methods, classes, and interfaces.
3. **Constant Values**: There are many constant values scattered throughout the code. Consider defining them as enums or constants in a separate class to make them easier to maintain.
4. **Type Casting**: There's extensive use of type casting (e.g., ` ExpressionáfType.GetType()`). Consider using type-safe mechanisms like generics or the ` dynamo.Type` class to avoid Boxing and Unboxing.
5. **Recursion**: The `BuildPredicate` method is recursive, which can lead to stack overflow issues. Consider using a loop instead.
6. **Avoid Nullables**: The code uses nullable types (e.g., `object?`, `FilterParameter?`) extensively. Consider using the `Option<T>` pattern or the `Try`–`Get` pattern to make the code more explicit.
7. **Unit Testing**: There's no indication of unit tests in the code. Consider writing test cases to ensure the code behaves as expected.
8. **Code Duplication**: There are many duplicated code snippets throughout the code. Consider extracting common logic into separate methods or interfaces.
9. **Naming Conventions**: The code follows a decent naming convention, but some names (e.g., `expressionOperator`, `expressionExtensions`) could be more descriptive.
10. **Performance**: The code uses reflection extensively, which can impact performance. Consider using other approaches (e.g., attributes, IL manipulation) to optimize performance.

**Specific Changes**

1. Rename the `ExpressionExtensions` class to something more descriptive, e.g., `ExpressionBuilder`.
2. Extract the `BuildExpressions` method into a separate class to reduce coupling.
3. Consider replacing the `Enum` implementation with an enum class (e.g., `ChainTypes`).
4. Update the `GetSearchableExpressions` method to use a LINQ query instead of concatenating arrays.
5. Update the `BuildBinaryExpression` method to handle different operators more concisely.
6. Consider using a more specific exception type instead of `NotSupportedException` in the `GetPredicateExpression` method.
7. Update the `TryGetPropertyExpression` method to return a more meaningful result (e.g., a tuple) instead of `Expression<Func<TModel, object>>?`.
8. Extract the `SimplifyValue` method into a separate class to reduce coupling.
9. Consider using a type-safe approach to handle JSON types instead of using `JsonElement`.
10. Update the `ParameterReplacerExpressionVisitor` class to handle more complex expression structures.

**Next Steps**

1. Review the code for performance issues and optimize where necessary.
2. Implement unit tests for the critical methods.
3. Consider integrating the code with a dependency injection framework to improve maintainability.
4. Review the code for any security vulnerabilities.
5. Refactor the code to improve readability and maintainability.

Overall, the code is well-written, but there are areas that can be improved for better maintainability, scalability, and readability.
