As a senior software engineer/solutions architect, my primary focus will be on reviewing the overall architecture, coding patterns, methods, and structure of the codebase, and suggesting changes to make it more maintainable and scalable.

**Overall Architecture**

The codebase appears to be a set of extensions for ASP.NET Core, providing features such as authentication, authorization, search query support, and Swagger/OpenAPI integration. The architecture is primarily focused on providing these features through various extension methods and static classes.

**Code Organization**

The code is organized into separate classes and files for each feature, which is a good practice. However, some classes (e.g., `ApplicationBuilderExtensions`) have a large number of methods, which can make them harder to maintain and understand.

**Suggestions**

1. **Extract smaller classes**: Break down larger classes like `ApplicationBuilderExtensions` into smaller, more focused classes. This will improve cohesion and reduce complexity.
2. **Rename and refactor**: Rename some classes and methods to better reflect their purpose. For example, `TryAddAspNetCoreExtensions` could become `ConfigureAspNetCoreExtensions`.
3. **Consistent naming conventions**: Use consistent naming conventions throughout the codebase. For example, `Add` and `TryAdd` methods could be renamed to start with `Configure` or `Set` to make them more descriptive.
4. **Remove dead code**: Remove any dead or unused code to reduce clutter and improve maintainability.
5. **Improve docstrings and comments**: Write more comprehensive and accurate docstrings and comments to help other developers understand the code.

**Code Smell**

1. **Magic strings**: In `TryAddAspNetCoreExtensions`, some magic strings like "/health" are hardcoded. Consider replacing these with constants or configuration options.
2. **Boolean parameters**: In some cases, boolean parameters are used (e.g., `RequireAuthenticatedByDefault`). Consider using a configuration option or a separate class to manage these settings.
3. **Hardcoded values**: Some values like `7.6.3` for `Microsoft.IdentityModel.Logging` are hardcoded. Consider replacing them with configuration options or constants.

**Performance and Scalability**

1. **Avoid unnecessary registrations**: In some cases, services like `IActionContextAccessor` are registered without being used. Consider removing these registrations to improve performance and reduce unnecessary dependencies.
2. **Use async/await**: In some methods, consider using async/await programming pattern to improve performance and scalability.
3. **Configure services wisely**: In some cases, services are configured loosely (e.g., `TryAddSingleton`). Consider configuring services more tightly to reduce coupling and improve performance.

**Best Practices**

1. **Separate concerns**: Separate concerns into different classes and files to improve maintainability and scalability.
2. **Use dependency injection**: Use dependency injection to manage dependencies and improve testing and maintainability.
3. **Follow SOLID principles**: Follow SOLID principles (Single responsibility, Open/closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation, and Dependency inversion) to improve maintainability and scalability.

By addressing these suggestions and code smells, the codebase can be improved to be more maintainable, scalable, and efficient.
