As a senior software engineer/solutions architect, I'll review the provided source code and suggest changes to improve maintainability, scalability, and readability.

**Code Review**

1. The code is well-organized, and the separation of concerns is good.
2. The use of interfaces (e.g., `IControllerModelConvention`, `IDocumentFilter`) and dependency injection is good.
3. The `HealthChecksDocumentFilter` class is doing too much; it should be broken down into smaller, more focused classes.
4. The `HealthCheckSwaggerGenEndpointOptions` class is simple and does its job, but its name could be improved.
5. The `ApiNamespaceControllerModelConvention` class is straightforward, but it's not clear why it's needed.

**Suggested Changes**

**1. Break down `HealthChecksDocumentFilter`**

Instead of having a single class that does everything, create separate classes for:

* `HealthCheckEndpointConfig`: responsible for defining the health check endpoint configuration (e.g., path, method, response schema).
* `HealthCheckDocumentFilter`: responsible for filtering the OpenAPI document (e.g., adding the health check endpoint).

This will make the code more modular and easier to maintain.

**2. rename `HealthCheckSwaggerGenEndpointOptions`**

Consider renaming this class to something like `HealthCheckSwaggerGenSettings` to better reflect its purpose.

**3. Simplify `ApiNamespaceControllerModelConvention`**

If this class is only used to set the `GroupName` property of the controller model, consider removing it and setting the property directly in the controller configuration.

**4. Consider using a more robust configuration mechanism for `HealthCheckEndpoint`**

Instead of hardcoding the `HealthCheckEndpoint` constant, consider using a configuration mechanism (e.g., appsettings.json, environment variables) to allow for customization.

**5. Add tests**

Write unit tests for the new classes to ensure they behave as expected.

**Updated Code Structure**

```csharp
// HealthCheckEndpointConfig.cs
public class HealthCheckEndpointConfig
{
    public string Path { get; set; }
    public string Method { get; set; }
    public OpenApiSchema ResponseSchema { get; set; }
}

// HealthCheckDocumentFilter.cs
public class HealthCheckDocumentFilter : IDocumentFilter
{
    private readonly HealthCheckEndpointConfig _endpointConfig;

    public HealthCheckDocumentFilter(HealthCheckEndpointConfig endpointConfig)
    {
        _endpointConfig = endpointConfig;
    }

    public void Apply(OpenApiDocument openApiDocument, DocumentFilterContext context)
    {
        // ...
    }
}

// HealthCheckSwaggerGenSettings.cs
public class HealthCheckSwaggerGenSettings : IConfigureOptions<SwaggerGenOptions>
{
    public void Configure(SwaggerGenOptions options)
    {
        options.DocumentFilter<HealthCheckDocumentFilter>();
    }
}
```

Remember to refactor the existing code to reflect these changes and ensure that the updated code meets the required functionality.
