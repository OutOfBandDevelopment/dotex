**Readme File**

This repository contains a set of ASP.NET Core filters that enhance the functionality of Swagger/UI by providing additional features for managing application permissions, queryable data sources, and file uploads.

**Technical Summary**

The filters in this repository utilize various design patterns and architectural patterns to achieve their goals. The `ApplicationPermissionsApiFilter` uses the Repository Pattern to manage application permissions, while the `SearchQueryOperationFilter` and `SearchQueryResultFilter` use the Service Locator Pattern to provide instances of query builders and search query objects. The `FormFileOperationFilter` uses the Factory Pattern to generate OpenApiSchema objects for file uploads.

In this component diagram, we see the following components:

1. `ApplicationPermissionsApiFilter`: An extension for Swagger/OpenAPI that provides additional information about application permissions.
2. `FormFileOperationFilter`: An extension for Swagger/OpenAPI that provides information about file uploads.
3. `SearchQueryOperationFilter`: An extension for Swagger/OpenAPI that provides information about queryable data sources.
4. `SearchQueryResultFilter`: An extension for ASP.NET Core that intercepts and completes queries based on user inputs.
5. `IServiceProvider`: A service locator that provides instances of query builders and search query objects.
6. `ILogger`: A logging mechanism that records events and errors.

These components work together to provide a robust and scalable solution for managing application permissions, queryable data sources, and file uploads in ASP.NET Core applications.
