What a delightful set of code reviews! Here are some suggestions to improve the maintainability of these classes:

**ApplicationPermissionsApiFilter.cs**

1. Consider using a more descriptive name for the class, such as `ApplicationRightsFilter` to make it clearer what the class is responsible for.
2. Instead of concatenating strings, use string interpolation (`$` syntax) to make the code more readable.
3. The `operation.Extensions.Add` line is redundant, as the `Add` method returns a reference to the collection. You can simplify the code to `operation.Extensions["x-permissions"] = new ApiPermissionsExtension...`.

**FormFileOperationFilter.cs**

1. Similar to the previous suggestion, consider a more descriptive name for the class, such as `FileUploadFilter`.
2. The code is quite concise, so no major suggestions here.

**SearchQueryOperationFilter.cs**

1. The class name is long, consider shortening it to `SearchQueryFilter` or `QueryFilter`.
2. The `Apply` method is quite lengthy and complex. Consider breaking it down into smaller, more manageable methods or properties.
3. The code uses a lot of nested LINQ statements, which can make the code harder to read. Consider simplifying these statements or using more readable alternatives.
4. The `TryLookupByType` method is not necessary, as you can use the `SchemaRepository.Schemas` dictionary to look up schema references directly.
5. The `UpdateRequestSchema` method is quite long and does a lot of schema manipulation. Consider breaking it down into smaller methods or using a more domain-specific approach.

**SearchQueryResultFilter.cs**

1. The class name is quite long, consider shortening it to `SearchQueryFilter` or `QueryResultFilter`.
