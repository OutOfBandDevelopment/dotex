# OoBDev.Search

This repository provides a set of libraries for searching documents, including document summary generation, hybrid searching, and vector stores.

The OoBDev.Search library provides a range of functionality for searching documents, including:

* Document summary generation: this can be done asynchronously
* Hybrid searching: combines results from lexical and semantic search providers
* Vector stores: creates vector stores based on specified containers or types
* Service collection extensions: configures search-related services for dependency injection

The library is designed to be modular and extensible, with a clear separation of concerns between each component. The following design patterns and architectural patterns are used:

* Dependency injection: the library uses Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection to manage dependencies between components
* Modular design: each component is designed to be a self-contained module that can be easily reused or extended
* Factory patterns: the library uses factory patterns to create instances of components, such as vector stores and search providers

The following component diagram illustrates the relationships between the different components of the library:
```plantuml
@startuml
class ServiceCollectionExtensions {
  - tryAddSearchServices(IServiceCollection services)
}

class VectorsStoreFactory {
  - createVectorizerStore(IVectorStoreContainer container)
}

class WrappedVectorStore {
  + wrapVectorStore(IVectorStore vectorStore)
}

class SearchProvider {
  + searchDocument(documentId: string)
}

class SemanticSearchProvider {
  + searchDocument(documentId: string)
}

class LexicalSearchProvider {
  + searchDocument(documentId: string)
}

class HybridSearchProvider {
  + searchDocument(documentId: string)
}

ServiceCollectionExtensions -->> SearchProvider
SearchProvider -->> Semantics
SearchProvider -->> LexicalSearchProvider
VectorsStoreFactory -->> WrappedVectorStore
WrappedVectorStore -->> VectorStore

This diagram shows the flow of data and control between the different components of the library. The `ServiceCollectionExtensions` class configures the libraries and creates instances of the other components. The `VectorsStoreFactory` class creates instances of vector stores, which are then wrapped by the `WrappedVectorStore` class. The `SearchProvider` class combines the results from the different search providers, including the semantic, lexical, and hybrid providers.
