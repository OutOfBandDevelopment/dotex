Overall, the code is well-structured, and the classes are following the Single Responsibility Principle. However, there are some areas where improvements can be made to make the code more maintainable.

**MessageReceiverProviderFactory.cs**

1. The constructor has a lot of parameters, which can be overwhelming. Consider breaking it down into smaller constructors or using dependency injection to inject the services and handlers.
2. The `handlersByChannel` LINQ query is quite complex. Consider breaking it down into smaller, reusable methods for better readability and maintainability.
3. The `logger` object is being used extensively throughout the method. Consider injecting a logger instance or using a logging abstraction layer to make the code more flexible.
4. The `Item` class in the `handlersByChannel` query is used as a temporary variable. Consider using a more descriptive variable name, such as `handlerConfig`.

**Suggested changes**

1. Break down the constructor into smaller, more manageable parts:
```csharp
public class MessageReceiverProviderFactory
{
    public MessageReceiverProviderFactory(IServiceProvider serviceProvider, ILogger<MessageReceiverProviderFactory> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public MessageReceiverProviderFactory(IEnumerable<IMessageQueueHandler> handlers, IMessagePropertyResolver resolver, IServiceProvider serviceProvider)
        : this(serviceProvider, logger: serviceProvider.GetService<ILogger<MessageReceiverProviderFactory>>())
    {
    }
}
```
2. Extract the `handlersByChannel` query into a separate method:
```csharp
private IEnumerable<MessageReceiverProviderFactoryItem> GetHandlersByChannel(IEnumerable<IMessageQueueHandler> handlers)
{
    // Complex LINQ query goes here
}
```
3. Use a logging abstraction layer to make the code more flexible:
```csharp
private readonly ILogger _logger;
public MessageReceiverProviderFactory(ILogger<MessageReceiverProviderFactory> logger)
{
    _logger = logger;
}
```
4. Rename the `Item` variable in the `handlersByChannel` query to something more descriptive:
```csharp
private IEnumerable<MessageReceiverProviderFactoryItem> GetHandlersByChannel(IEnumerable<IMessageQueueHandler> handlers)
{
    var handlersByChannel = from handler in handlers
                            // Complex LINQ query goes here
}
```
**MessageSenderProviderFactory.cs**

1. The `Sender` method has only two parameters, which is a good sign. However, the method name could be more descriptive, such as `GetSenderProvider`.
2. The `providerKey` variable is used to resolve the provider instance. Consider using a more descriptive variable name, such as `senderProviderKey`.

**Suggested changes**

1. Rename the `Sender` method to something more descriptive:
```csharp
public virtual IMessageSenderProvider GetSenderProvider(Type channelType, Type messageType)
{
    // Implementation remains the same
}
```
2. Use a more descriptive variable name for the `providerKey` variable:
```csharp
private string senderProviderKey = resolver.Provider(channelType, messageType);
```
Overall, the code is well-structured, and the suggested changes are aimed at improving readability, maintainability, and flexibility.
