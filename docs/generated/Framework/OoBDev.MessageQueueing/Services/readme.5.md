**README File**

This project provides a set of classes for message queueing services. The classes are designed to work together to provide a flexible and modular system for sending and receiving messages.

**Summary**

The MessageReceiverProviderFactory and MessageSenderProviderFactory classes are responsible for creating instances of IMessageReceiverProvider and IMessageSenderProvider, respectively. These factories use the MessagePropertyResolver class to determine the correct provider to create based on the channel and message types.

The MessageReceiverProviderFactory class creates instances of IMessageReceiverProvider by grouping handlers by channel and message type, and then creating a provider for each group. The providers are created using the ServiceProvider and IMessagePropertyResolver. The creation process also checks for any configuration settings that may affect the creation of the providers.

The MessageSenderProviderFactory class creates instances of IMessageSenderProvider by using the ServiceProvider and IMessagePropertyResolver to determine the correct provider to create for a given channel and message type.

**Technical Summary**

The design pattern used in this project is the Factory pattern, which is used to create instances of IMessageReceiverProvider and IMessageSenderProvider. The Factory pattern is used to encapsulate the creation of these providers, making it easier to add new providers and to change the way providers are created.

The architecture pattern used in this project is the Service Provider pattern, which is used to provide a way to resolve services using a flexible and extensible approach. The ServiceProvider is used to resolve instances of IMessageReceiverProvider, IMessageSenderProvider, and other services.

**Component Diagram**

Here is a component diagram using PlantUML:
```
```plantuml
@startuml
class MessageReceiverProviderFactory {
  - IMessagePropertyResolver resolver
  - IServiceProvider serviceProvider
  - ILogger logger
  + Create() : IEnumerable<IMessageReceiverProvider>
}

class MessageSenderProviderFactory {
  - IServiceProvider serviceProvider
  - IMessagePropertyResolver resolver
  + Sender(Type channelType, Type messageType) : IMessageSenderProvider
}

class IMessageReceiverProvider {
  + Start()
  + Stop()
}

class IMessageSenderProvider {
  + Send(Message message)
}

class MessageHandlerProvider {
  + SetHandlers(IEnumerable<IMessageQueueHandler> handlers)
  + SetChannelType(Type channelType)
  + SetConfig(Configuration config)
}

class IMessageQueueHandler {
  + Handle(Message message)
}

class Message {
  + getMessageType() : Type
}

class Configuration {
  + getConfigurationSection() : Section
}

Section {
  + get[string key] : string
}
