A great opportunity to review some code! As a senior software engineer/solutions architect, I'll provide you with feedback on the coding patterns, methods, structure, and classes to make the code more maintainable.

**Obervations and Suggestions**

1. **Naming Conventions**
	* In `TestExceptionMessageSenderProvider.cs`, the class name `TestExceptionMessageSenderProvider` is quite long and doesn't follow the conventional camelCase naming convention. Consider renaming it to something like `ExceptionMessageSenderProviderTest`.
	* In `TestMessageSenderProvider.cs`, the class name `TestMessageSenderProvider` also doesn't follow the conventional naming convention. Renaming it to `MessageSenderProviderTest` would be more readable.
2. **Class Structure and Organization**
	* The classes `TestExceptionMessageSenderProvider` and `TestMessageSenderProvider` are doing too much: they implement the `IMessageSenderProvider` interface and have a `SendAsync` method, but they also include other logic (e.g., logging, context manipulation) that could be extracted into separate classes or methods.
	* Consider creating separate classes for the logging logic, the context manipulation, and the implementation of `IMessageSenderProvider`. This would make the code more modular and easier to maintain.
3. **Method Signatures**
	* The `SendAsync` method in `TestMessageSenderProvider.cs` takes two object parameters, `message` and `context`. However, the method doesn't actually use the `context` parameter. Consider removing it or renaming the method to `SendAsync(object message)` to reflect the actual signature.
4. **Exception Handling**
	* In `TestExceptionMessageSenderProvider.cs`, the `SendAsync` method throws a new `ApplicationException`. Consider catching and rethrowing the exception instead, or handling it more robustly.
5. **Code Duplication**
	* The `AddResult` method is called twice in `TestMessageSenderProvider.cs`, once for `message` and once for `context`. Consider extracting this logic into a separate method or creating a utility class to avoid code duplication.
6. **Testing**
	* The absence of tests for `TestMessage` and `TestMessageSenderProvider` raises concerns about their correctness. Consider adding some unit tests to ensure these classes are functional.

**Proposed Changes**

1. Extract logging logic into a separate class `LoggerHelper`:
```csharp
public class LoggerHelper
{
    private readonly ILogger _logger;

    public LoggerHelper(ILogger logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public void LogInformation(string message, object obj)
    {
        _logger.LogInformation($"{message}({obj})");
    }
}
```
Use this class to log information in `TestMessageSenderProvider`.

2. Extract context manipulation logic into a separate class `ContextHelper`:
```csharp
public class ContextHelper
{
    private readonly TestContext _context;

    public ContextHelper(TestContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
    }

    public void AddResult(object message, string fileName)
    {
        _context.AddResult(message, fileName);
    }
}
```
Use this class to manipulate the context in `TestMessageSenderProvider`.

3. Rename classes and methods to follow conventional naming conventions.

4. Review and refactor the `SendAsync` method in `TestMessageSenderProvider` to handle exceptions more robustly.

5. Extract code duplication into separate methods or create a utility class.

6. Write unit tests for `TestMessage` and `TestMessageSenderProvider` classes.

By addressing these suggestions, you can improve the maintainability, readability, and scalability of the code.
