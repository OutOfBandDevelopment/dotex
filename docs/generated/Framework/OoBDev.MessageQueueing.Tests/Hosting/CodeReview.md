As a senior software engineer/solutions architect, I'll review the provided source code and suggest changes to improve maintainability.

**Class Structure and Naming**

The `MessageReceiverHostTests` class follows the standard pattern for unit testing. However, it's a good practice to follow the SOLID principles and separate concerns. Consider breaking this class into smaller, more focused classes, such as `MessageReceiverHostTestBase` and `StartStopTest`.

**Test Context**

The `TestContext` is used to capture output from the tests. While this is a common approach, consider using a logging framework like Serilog or Log4Net to handle logging for tests.

**Data Preparation and Setup**

The test method is quite lengthy and performs multiple setup tasks. Consider breaking this into separate methods or constructor injection to make the test more readable and maintainable.

**Test Method**

The `StartStopTest` method is complicated and has multiple responsibilities (setup, test, shutdown). This can lead to test issues if the setup or shutdown steps fail. Consider breaking this into smaller test methods, each with a single responsibility (e.g., `StartTest`, `ShutdownTest`, `ShutdownTestAfterCancel`).

**Code Duplication**

The test method creates two `CancellationTokenSource` instances (`cancellationTokenSourceBlocker` and `cancellationTokenSource`). This can lead to code duplication and maintenance issues. Consider creating a separate method to create and manage cancellation tokens.

**Test Method Redundancy**

The test checks if the `StopAsync` method is called after cancellation. This can be combined with the cancellation check in the `StartStopTest` method.

**Additional Suggestions**

1. Consider using a more descriptive name for the `StartStopTest` method, such as `CancelAndStopAsyncTest`.
2. Use a more explicit naming convention for the test methods (e.g., `TestXyz` instead of `Xyz`).
3. Use a logging framework to handle logging for tests and avoid using `TestContext.WriteLine`.
4. Add comments to explain the purpose of the test methods and the setup steps.
5. Consider using a more robust testing framework like SpecFlow or MSpec to structure your tests.

**Refactored Code**

Here is a refactored version of the `MessageReceiverHostTests` class:
```csharp
[TestClass]
public class MessageReceiverHostTests
{
    private readonly TestLogger<MessageReceiverHost> _logger;
    private readonly IMessageReceiverProviderFactory _receiverProviderFactory;
    private readonly CancellationTokenSource _cancellationTokenSource = new CancellationTokenSource();

    public MessageReceiverHostTests(TestLogger<MessageReceiverHost> logger, IMessageReceiverProviderFactory receiverProviderFactory)
    {
        _logger = logger;
        _receiverProviderFactory = receiverProviderFactory;
    }

    [TestMethod]
    [TestCategory(TestCategories.Unit)]
    public async Task CancelAndStopAsyncTest()
    {
        // Arrange
        var mockReceiverProvider = CreateMockReceiverProvider();
        var host = CreateMessageReceiverHost(mockReceiverProvider);

        // Act and Assert
        await StartAndStopHostAsync(host);
        VerifyRecevierProviderWasRun(mockReceiverProvider);
    }

    private async Task StartAndStopHostAsync(MessageReceiverHost host)
    {
        await host.StartAsync(_cancellationTokenSource.Token);
        while (!_cancellationTokenSource.IsCancellationRequested)
        {
            await Task.Yield();
        }
        await host.StopAsync(_cancellationTokenSource.Token);
    }

    private Mock<IMessageReceiverProvider> CreateMockReceiverProvider()
    {
        var mockReceiverProvider = new Mock<IMessageReceiverProvider>(MockBehavior.Strict);
        mockReceiverProvider
            .Setup(s => s.RunAsync(It.IsAny<CancellationToken>()))
            .Returns(Task.CompletedTask)
            .Callback(async () =>
            {
                _logger.WriteLine("Ran Child!");
                await _cancellationTokenSource.CancelAsync();
                await Task.Delay(100);
            });
        return mockReceiverProvider;
    }

    private MessageReceiverHost CreateMessageReceiverHost(IMessageReceiverProvider receiverProvider)
    {
        return new MessageReceiverHost(_logger, receiverProvider);
    }

    private void VerifyRecevierProviderWasRun(Mock<IMessageReceiverProvider> mockReceiverProvider)
    {
        // Verify that the receiver provider was run
        mockReceiverProvider.VerifyAll();
    }
}
```
The above code follows the same functionality as the original, but with improved maintainability, code separation, and clarity.
