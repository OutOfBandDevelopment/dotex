**README file**

**Summary**

This repository contains a set of files related to message queuing functionality. The main components are:

* `OoBDev.MessageQueueing.Tests` - a .NET test project that contains unit tests for message sending functionality.
* `OoBDev.Extensions` - a set of extension methods for message queuing.
* `OoBDev.MessageQueueing` - the core library for message queuing.
* `OoBDev.System` - a set of utility classes for message queuing.

**Technical Summary**

The code uses the following design patterns and architectural patterns:

* Dependency Injection: The code uses a ServiceCollection to manage the lifetime of objects and provide them to requesting clients.
* Registry Pattern: The `GetServiceProvider` method provides a singleton instance of a service provider, which manages the creation and disposal of objects.
* Facade Pattern: The `GetRequiredService` method provides a facade to access services registered in the ServiceCollection.
* Business Logic: The code separates business logic from data access and presentation layers, and uses a layered architecture to encapsulate complex logic.
