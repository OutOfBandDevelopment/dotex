As a senior software engineer and solutions architect, I've reviewed the provided code and identified some potential issues and areas for improvement. Here are some suggestions:

1. **TestContext**: The `TestContext` class is not necessary in this context. You can remove it to make the tests more concise and easier to read.
2. **Repeated code**: The `mockrepo.VerifyAll();` line is repeated in almost every test. Consider creating a separate method to handle verification to avoid duplication and improve maintainability.
3. **Naming conventions**: Some method names, such as `CreateTest_Named_Keyed` and `CreateTest_NoTag`, are not very descriptive. Try to use more descriptive names that convey the purpose of the test.
4. **Test isolation**: Some tests, such as `CreateTest_Named_Factory`, depend on the presence of custom attributes. This can lead to difficulty in isolating the test assumptions. Consider using a separate test setup to isolate the test.
5. **Test coverage**: The tests seem to cover most of the code, but there are some areas that are not tested, such as the `IBlobContainerFactory` implementation. Consider adding more tests to increase code coverage.
6. **Service detection**: In `ServiceRegistryTests`, the service detection using `services.GetKeyedService<IBlobContainer>("TestName")` is not very robust. Consider using a more reliable approach, such as injecting the service instance.
7. **BlobContainerFactory**: The `BlobContainerFactory` class seems to be responsible for creating instances of `IBlobContainer`. Consider making this more explicit by injecting the factory instance into the `WrappedBlobContainer` class.
8. **WrappedBlobContainerTests**: Some tests, such as `DeleteContentAsyncTest`, `GetContentAsyncTest`, and `StoreContentAsyncTest`, seem to be testing the same method repeatedly. Consider creating a test class for each method to improve maintainability.
9. **QueryContentTest**: The `QueryContentTest` method seems to be testing a very specific implementation detail. Consider creating a separate test class for this method to isolate the test assumptions.

Here's an updated version of the code with some of these suggestions implemented:
```csharp
// BlobContainerFactoryTests.cs
[TestClass]
public class BlobContainerFactoryTests
{
    [TestMethod]
    public void CreateTest_Named_Keyed()
    {
        var testName = "container target";
        var mockProvider = new Mock<IBlobContainerProvider>(MockBehavior.Strict);

        var services = new ServiceCollection();
        services.AddKeyedTransient(testName, (_, _) => mockProvider.Object);
        var serviceProvider = services.BuildServiceProvider();

        var factory = new BlobContainerFactory(serviceProvider, TestLogger.CreateLogger<BlobContainerFactory>());
        var instance = factory.Create(testName);

        Assert.IsNotNull(instance);
    }

    // ...
}

// WrappedBlobContainerTests.cs
[TestClass]
public class WrappedBlobContainerTests
{
    [TestMethod]
    public async Task DeleteContentAsyncTest()
    {
        var path = "test path";
        var mockFactory = new Mock<IWrappedBlobContainerFactory>();
        var mockBlobContainer = new Mock<IBlobContainer<NoTag>>();

        mockFactory.Setup(s => s.Create<NoTag>()).Returns(mockBlobContainer.Object);
        mockBlobContainer.Setup(s => s.DeleteContentAsync(path)).Returns(Task.CompletedTask);

        var container = new WrappedBlobContainer<NoTag>(mockFactory.Object);
        await container.DeleteContentAsync(path);

        mockFactory.Verify(s => s.Create<NoTag>(), Times.Once);
        mockBlobContainer.Verify(s => s.DeleteContentAsync(path), Times.Once);
    }

    // ...
}

// IWrappedBlobContainerFactory.cs
public interface IWrappedBlobContainerFactory
{
    IBlobContainer<T> Create<T>();
}

// WrappedBlobContainer.cs
public class WrappedBlobContainer<T> : IBlobContainer<T>
{
    private readonly IWrappedBlobContainerFactory _factory;

    public WrappedBlobContainer(IWrappedBlobContainerFactory factory)
    {
        _factory = factory;
    }

    public Task DeleteContentAsync(string path)
    {
        var blobContainer = _factory.Create<T>();
        return blobContainer.DeleteContentAsync(path);
    }

    // ...
}
```
These changes aim to improve test readability, maintainability, and robustness. They also help to separate the concerns of the `BlobContainerFactory` and `WrappedBlobContainer` classes.
