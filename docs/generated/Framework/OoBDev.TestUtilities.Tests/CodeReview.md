As a senior software engineer/solutions architect, I'll review the source code and suggest changes to improve maintainability.

**Positive aspects:**

1. The tests are well-structured and follow a consistent pattern.
2. There's a clear separation of concerns between the test context and the test methods.
3. The tests cover various scenarios and edge cases.

**Negative aspects and suggestions:**

1. **Naming conventions:** The class and method names could be improved for better readability and consistency. For example, `TextContextExtensionsTests` could be renamed to `TextContextExtensionsTestEngine`.
2. **Test method naming:** Inconsistent naming conventions are used in test method names. For example, `AddResultTest_Object` is named differently from `AddResultFileTest_FileContent`. Consider using a consistent naming convention, such as `TestAddResultObject`.
3. **Magic numbers:** In some cases, magic numbers (e.g., `8.0.0`, `6.0.1`) are used without explanation. Consider defining constants for such values.
4. **Redundant code:** Some test methods have similar code blocks, which can be extracted into a separate method or a test setup.
5. **Test data:** The test data is hardcoded, which can lead to maintenance issues if the data needs to be updated. Consider using data factories or test data builders.
6. **Output file management:** In some tests, output files are written to the disk. Consider using a temporary file approach or a testing framework that provides file management features.
7. **Async tests:** Some tests are marked as async, but the await keyword is not used consistently. Ensure that async tests use the await keyword correctly.

**Changes:**

1. Rename the class to `TextContextExtensionsTestEngine`.
2. Standardize test method naming using a consistent convention (e.g., `TestAddResultObject`).
3. Define constants for commonly used values (e.g., `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection`, `System.Linq.Async`).
4. Extract redundant code blocks into separate methods or test setup.
5. Implement data factories or test data builders for test data.
6. Use temporary files or a testing framework's file management features for output files.
7. Fix async tests to use the await keyword correctly.
8. Remove magic numbers and replace them with named constants or variables.
9. Consider using a testing framework that provides features for automating tests, such as parameterized tests or test data generation.

Here's an updated version of the code:
```csharp
public class TextContextExtensionsTestEngine
{
    public TestContext TestContext { get; set; }

    public class TestData
    {
        public string Property1 { get; set; } = "Hello World!";
    }

    [TestMethod]
    [TestCategory(TestCategories.Unit)]
    public void TestAddResultObject()
    {
        // Stage
        var value = new TestData();

        // Mock

        // Test
        var context = TestContext.AddResult(value);

        // Assert
        Assert.AreEqual(TestContext, context);
        Assert.IsTrue(Directory.EnumerateFiles(context.TestRunResultsDirectory, "*.json").Any());
    }

    // ... other tests ...
}

public static class TestContextExtensions
{
    public static TestContext AddResult(this TestContext context, object value)
    {
        // implementation
    }

    // ... other test extensions ...
}
```
Remember to update the test data files (`TextContextExtensionsTests_GetTestDataAsyncTest.json`, `TextContextExtensionsTests_GetTestDataAsyncTest_Stream.json`, and `TextContextExtensionsTests_GetTestDataAsyncTest_String.json`) accordingly.
