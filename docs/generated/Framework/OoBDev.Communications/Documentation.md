**OoBDev.Communications Library**
============================

**Overview**
----------

The OoBDev Communications libraries are designed to provide an abstraction for asynchronously sending messages over dedicated channels such as Email and SMS.

**Example**
--------

The `ICommunicationSender<>` interface provides a means to interact with various channel providers. Example channels are hosted for `EmailMessageModel` and `SmsMessageModel`.

**Class Diagram**
`````plantuml
@startuml
class EmailMessageModel {
  - messageBody: string
  - subject: string
}

class SmsMessageModel {
  - messageBody: string
}

interface ICommunicationSender<T> {
  SendAsync(T message): Task<string>
}

class EmailCommunicationSender implements ICommunicationSender<EmailMessageModel> {
  # implementation
}

class SmsCommunicationSender implements ICommunicationSender<SmsMessageModel> {
  # implementation
}

EmailMessageModel --* ICommunicationSender<EmailMessageModel>
SmsMessageModel --* ICommunicationSender<SmsMessageModel>

**OoBDev.Communications**

* `ICommunicationSender<>`: Interface for sending messages asynchronously over various channels.
* `EmailCommunicationSender`: Class implementing `ICommunicationSender<>` for sending Email messages.
* `SmsCommunicationSender`: Class implementing `ICommunicationSender<>` for sending SMS messages.

**ServiceCollectionExtensions**
---------------------------

**Overview**
----------

The `ServiceCollectionExtensions` class provides extension methods for configuring communication services in `IServiceCollection`.

**Sequence Diagram**
`````plantuml
@startuml
participant User as user
participant ServiceCollection as services
participant ICommunicationSender as sender

user -> services: AddCommunicationServices()

sender -> services: TryAddCommunicationsServices()

user -> sender: GetCommunicationSender()

sender -> user: CommunicationSender
