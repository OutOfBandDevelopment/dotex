As a senior software engineer/solutions architect, I'll provide an in-depth review of the provided source code and suggest changes to improve maintainability, scalability, and overall design.

**Project Structure**

The provided `.csproj` file contains a proper namespace and language settings. It also includes a readable README file with documentation for the project.

**MessageReceiverHost**

1. **Class naming convention**: Instead of using camelCase for variable and method names, prefer PascalCase to maintain consistency throughout the codebase.
2. **Class and method names**: `MessageReceiverHost` can be renamed to `MessageQueueHost` to better reflect its purpose. Similarly, methods like `StartAsync` and `StopAsync` can be renamed to `StartMessageQueueing` and `StopMessageQueueing`.
3. **Dispose pattern**: The `Dispose` method is properly implemented, but it can be improved by adding a `Finalize` method to handle finalization. This ensures that resources are properly released even if the `Dispose` method is not called.
4. ** token handling**: Consider using a more robust cancellation token implementation, such as `CancellationTokenSource.Dispose` instead of `Cancel`.
5. **Provider management**: Instead of storing provider instances in a list (`_tasks`), consider using a dictionary to store providers by their names or IDs. This makes it easier to manage and dispose of providers.
6. **Error handling**: The error handling mechanism can be improved by catching specific exceptions and providing more informative error messages.

**ServiceCollectionExtensions**

1. **Method naming convention**: The `TryAddMessageQueueingHosting` method can be renamed to `AddMessageQueueingHosting` to better reflect its purpose.
2. **Method implementation**: The method implementation is simple and only adds a singleton instance of `MessageReceiverHost`. Consider adding more configurable options for the host, such as the ability to specify the providers to use.

**Additional Recommendations**

1. **Separate concerns**: Consider separating the concerns of the `MessageQueueHost` class into smaller, more focused classes. For example, you can have a `MessageQueueProvider` class that handles the provider management and a `MessageQueueService` class that handles the message queueing.
2. **Loguru**: Consider using a logging library like Loguru to simplify logging and provide more advanced logging features.
3. **Dependency injection**: Consider using a dependency injection framework like Autofac or Ninject to simplify the injection of dependencies.
4. **Error logging**: Consider implementing a central error logging mechanism to collect and handle errors across the application.

**Refactored Code**

Here's an example of how the refactored code could look:
```csharp
public class MessageQueueHost : IHostedService, IDisposable
{
    private readonly HttpClient _httpClient;
    private readonly ILogger<MessageQueueHost> _logger;
    private readonly IServiceProvider _serviceProvider;
    private readonly Dictionary<string, IMessageReceiverProvider> _providers;

    public MessageQueueHost(HttpClient httpClient, ILogger<MessageQueueHost> logger, IServiceProvider serviceProvider)
    {
        _httpClient = httpClient;
        _logger = logger;
        _serviceProvider = serviceProvider;
        _providers = new Dictionary<string, IMessageReceiverProvider>();
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        Dispose(true);
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }

    protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
    {
        if (disposing)
        {
            _providers.Clear();
        }
    }

    public Task StartAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("Starting message queueing host");

        foreach (var provider in _providers.Values)
        {
            _logger.LogInformation($"Starting: {provider.Name}");
            var task = provider.RunAsync(cancellationToken);
            _logger.LogInformation($"Started: {provider.Name}");
            await task;
        }

        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }

    public Task StopAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("Stopping message queueing host");

        foreach (var provider in _providers.Values)
        {
            _logger.LogInformation($"Stopping: {provider.Name}");
            provider.StopAsync(cancellationToken);
        }

        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

```csharp
public static class ServiceCollectionExtensions
{
    public static IServiceCollection AddMessageQueueingHosting(this IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddSingleton<IMessageReceiverProvider>( serviceProvider =>
        {
            // Create and configure message receiver provider instances
            // ...
        });
        services.AddHostedService<MessageQueueHost>();
        return services;
    }
}
```
Note that this is just a starting point, and the actual refactored code will depend on the specific requirements and design of the project.
