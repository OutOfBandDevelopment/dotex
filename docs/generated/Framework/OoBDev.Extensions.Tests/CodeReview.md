I'll provide a review of the code from the perspective of a senior software engineer/solutions architect, highlighting potential issues and suggesting improvements.

**Project File**

The project file is well-structured, and the settings are standard for a .NET test project.

**Test Class and Methods**

The `StringToolsTests` class is a good starting point, but there are a few issues and areas for improvement:

1. **Magic strings**: The `TestContext` property has a name that is not self-explanatory. Consider renaming it to something like `TestSettings` or `TestRunner`.
2. **Data-driven testing**: The use of `DataTestMethod` and `DataRow` attributes is a good practice. However, consider creating a separate class or file for the test data, making it easier to manage and maintain.
3. **Test methods**: There are multiple test methods with similar logic. This could be extracted into a separate method or a helper class to reduce duplication.
4. **Platform-specific logic**: The test method checks the platform (Windows vs. not Windows) and performs different actions based on the result. This could be improved by using a more elegant approach, such as using a library that provides platform-aware functionality.
5. **Incomplete testing**: The test methods only cover a limited set of scenarios. Consider adding more test cases to ensure that the method is thoroughly tested.

**Suggestions**

1. Extract the platform-specific logic into a separate method or a helper class.
2. Create a separate class or file for test data.
3. Use a more descriptive name for the `TestContext` property.
4. Add more test cases to ensure that the method is thoroughly tested.
5. Consider using a more elegant approach, such as using a library that provides platform-aware functionality.

Here is an updated version of the code based on the suggestions:
```csharp
[TestClass]
public class StringToolsTests
{
    private readonly TestSettings _testSettings;

    public StringToolsTests(TestSettings testSettings)
    {
        _testSettings = testSettings;
    }

    [DataTestMethod]
    [DataRow("abcdefghijklmnop", @"abcdefghij
klmnop")]
    // ...

    [DataTestMethod]
    [DataRow("abcde fghijklmnop", @"abcde
fghijklmno
p"])]
    // ...

    public void Test(string input, string expected)
    {
        if (_testSettings.IsWindows())
        {
            var result = input.SplitBy(length: 10).WriteAsLines();
            Assert.AreEqual(expected, result);
        }
        else
        {
            // Apply platform-agnostic logic
            var result = input.SplitBy(length: 10).Any(i => i.Length <= 10);
            Assert.IsTrue(result);
        }
    }
}

public class TestSettings
{
    public bool IsWindows()
    {
        return Environment.OSVersion.Platform == PlatformID.Win32NT;
    }
}

public static class DataHelper
{
    public static readonly string[] TestData = new[]
    {
        // ...
    };
}
```
Note that this is just a suggested improvement, and you may choose to maintain the original code or implement different changes.
