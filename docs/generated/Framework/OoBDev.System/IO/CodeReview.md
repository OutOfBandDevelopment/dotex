As a senior software engineer/solutions architect, I've reviewed the provided source code and identified several areas for improvement to make the code more maintainable. I'll present my suggestions below.

**NativeWin32Methods.cs**

1. Consistent naming conventions: The class name `NativeWin32Methods` is consistent, but the methods and enum values use a mix of PascalCase and camelCase. It's better to stick to one convention throughout the codebase.
2. Consider creating a separate class for `MoveFileEx` to encapsulate the native calls. This would help with abstraction and make the code easier to test.
3. The `MoveFileFlags` enum is very long. Consider breaking it down into smaller enums for better readability.

**TempFileFactory.cs**

1. Consider using a generic factory instead of a specific `TempFileHandle` type. This would allow for more flexibility and extensibility.
2. The `ActivatorUtilities.CreateInstance<TempFileHandle>(_serviceProvider)` call can be replaced with a more explicit `new` statement or a Factory pattern.
3. Consider adding a `GetTempFileAsync` method to support asynchronous operations.

**TempFileHandle.cs**

1. The `FilePath` property can be made lazy-loading to improve performance and reduce unnecessary file operations.
2. Consider using a `using` statement instead of a `finally` block for the file operations in the `Dispose` method.
3. The `Dispose` method is not part of the `IDisposable` interface. Instead, consider implementing the interface and following its guidelines.
4. The `Dispose(bool disposing)` method is not necessary and can be removed.
5. Consider using a `try`-`catch` block with a specific exception type instead of catching the general `Exception` type.
6. The `FilePath` property can be made read-only to prevent accidental modifications.
7. The `ToString` method can be overridden to return a more meaningful string representation of the `TempFileHandle` instance.

**Additional suggestions**

1. Consider using a logging framework like Serilog or NLog instead of the built-in `ILogger` to provide more features and flexibility.
2. The code does not appear to handle errors or exceptions in a generic way. Consider introducing a centralized error handling mechanism to improve the code's fault tolerance.
3. The `File` class can be wrapped in a `using` statement to ensure proper resource disposal.
4. Consider implementing a caching mechanism to reduce the number of file operations and improve performance.

**Proposed code changes**

Here's a proposed version of the `TempFileHandle` class with some of the suggested changes:
```csharp
public class TempFileHandle : ITempFile, IDisposable
{
    private readonly ILogger _logger;
    private readonly string _filepath;

    public TempFileHandle(ILogger<TempFileHandle> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
        _filepath = Path.GetTempFileName();
    }

    public string filepath => _filepath;

    public override string ToString() => filepath;

    public void Dispose()
    {
        using (var fileStream = new FileStream(_filepath, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.ReadWrite))
        {
            try
            {
                _logger.LogInformation("Deleting {FilePath}", _filepath);
                File.Delete(_filepath);
            }
            catch (IOException e)
            {
                _logger.LogWarning("Deleting {FilePath} failed: {Error}", _filepath, e.Message);
                if (!RuntimeInformation.IsOSPlatform(OSPlatform.Windows))
                {
                    throw;
                }
                try
                {
                    _logger.LogWarning("Deleting {FilePath} (MoveFileEx)", _filepath);
                    NativeWin32Methods.MoveFileEx(_filepath, null, NativeWin32Methods.MoveFileFlags.DelayUntilReboot);
                }
                catch (IOException e)
                {
                    _logger.LogError("Deleting {FilePath} (MoveFileEx) failed: {Error}", _filepath, e.Message);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
Note that this is just one possible implementation, and you may want to adapt these changes to your specific use case.
