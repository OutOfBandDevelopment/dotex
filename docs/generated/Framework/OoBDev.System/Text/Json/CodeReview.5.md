As a senior software engineer and solutions architect, I will review the source code and suggest changes to improve maintainability, readability, and performance.

**Class structure and naming**

The `JsonNodeExtensions` class contains many extension methods that operate on different types of `JsonNode` objects. It would be more organized to consider splitting this class into separate classes, each containing extension methods for a specific type of `JsonNode`. This would make the code more hierarchical and easier to understand.

For example, you could have one `JsonArrayExtensions` class containing methods for converting `JsonArray`s to `XFragment`s, and another `JsonObjectExtensions` class containing methods for converting `JsonObjects` to `XFragment`s.

**Method naming and parameters**

Some method names, such as `ToXNodeInternal`, `ToXNodesInternal`, and `ToXFragment`, are not very descriptive. It would be better to rename them to something like `ConvertToJsonNodeToXElement`, `ConvertJsonNodeCollectionToXFragment`, and `ConvertJsonNodeToXFragment`.

Additionally, some methods have unnecessary parameters, such as the `rootName` parameter in the `ToXFragment` method. This parameter could be removed, as it's not clearly documented what it's used for. If it's necessary to provide a default root name, it would be better to enforce this through the method's behavior rather than relying on an optional parameter.

**Exception handling**

The `NotSupportedException` exception is thrown in the `ToXNodeInternal` method when encountering an unsupported `JsonValueKind`. Instead of throwing an exception, it would be better to handle this scenario by logging a warning or returning a default value, as the code might still need to handle this situation in certain cases.

**Code organization**

The `ToJsonNodeExtensions` class contains many mutually recursive calls to `ToXNodesInternal` and `ToXNodeInternal` methods. This can make the code harder to understand and debug. It would be better to separate these methods into smaller, more straightforward methods, and consider using recursion or loops instead of mutually recursive calls.

**Performance**

The `ToXNodesInternal` method uses a query expression to filter out null values. This can be less efficient than using a foreach loop or LINQ's `Where` method. Additionally, the `ToXNodesInternal` method uses a series of switch statements to determine the type of `JsonNode` being converted. This can lead to slower performance and more complex code. It would be better to consider using a more efficient data structure, such as a dictionary, to map `JsonValueKind`s to their corresponding XML representation.

**Code readability**

The code could benefit from more descriptive variable names and better comments. For example, the `k` variable in the `ToXNodesInternal` method is used to store the `JsonValueKind`, but it's not clear what this variable represents. Adding a comment or renaming the variable to something more descriptive, such as `kind`, would improve code readability.

Here is an updated version of the code with some of these suggestions applied:
```csharp
public static class JsonArrayExtensions
{
    public static XFragment? ToXFragment(this JsonArray? json, string? rootName = null)
    {
        if (json == null)
        {
            return null;
        }

        // Convert each node in the array to an XFragment
        var elements = json.EnumerateObjects().Select(o => o.ToXNode());
        return new XFragment(new XElement(rootName ?? "x", elements));
    }

    private static XElement ToXNode(this JsonObject obj)
    {
        // Convert each property in the object to an XFragment
        var elements = obj.EnumerateProperties().Select(p => p.ToXNode());
        return new XElement("i", elements);
    }

    private static IEnumerable<XElement> ToXNodes(this IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, JsonNode>> nodes)
    {
        // Convert each node in the collection to an XFragment
        foreach (var pair in nodes)
        {
            var node = pair.Value;
            switch (node.GetValueKind())
            {
                case JsonValueKind.Number:
                    yield return new XElement("i", node.GetValue<double>().ToString());
                    break;
                case JsonValueKind.String:
                    yield return new XElement("i", node.GetValue<string>());
                    break;
                case JsonValueKind.Array:
                    yield return new XElement("i", node.AsArray().ToXFragment());
                    break;
                // ...
            }
        }
    }
}
```
Note that this is just one possible implementation, and there are many ways to improve the code. The primary goal is to make the code more maintainable, readable, and efficient.
