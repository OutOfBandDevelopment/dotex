**README File**

**Summary:**
This repository provides a set of source files that allow for serialization of data in various formats. The primary functionality is defined in the `SerializerTypes` enum, which specifies the different types of serialization formats supported, including JSON, BSON (Binary JSON), and XML. This allows developers to select the desired serialization format when working with data.

**Technical Summary:**
The design pattern used in this repository is enumerative programming, which is an extension of the Factory Design Pattern. The `SerializerTypes` enum serves as a factory, providing a list of possible serialization formats to the system. The use of an enum as a factory eliminates the need for conditional statements and switch cases, making the code more maintainable and scalable.

**Component Diagram:**
```plantuml
@startuml
class SerializerTypes {
  - enum
  + getSerializationFormat(string serializationType)
}

class JsonSerializer {
  + serialize(object data)
  + deserialize(string data)
}

class BsonSerializer {
  + serialize(object data)
  + deserialize(string data)
}

class XmlSerializer {
  + serialize(object data)
  + deserialize(string data)
}

SerializerTypes ->> JsonSerializer : JSON
SerializerTypes ->> BsonSerializer : BSON
SerializerTypes ->> XmlSerializer : XML
