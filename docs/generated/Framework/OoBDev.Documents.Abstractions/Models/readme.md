**README file**

**Summary**

The following source files define a set of models and interfaces for managing content metadata and references. The models include `ContentMetaDataReference`, `ContentReference`, and `DocumentType`, which provide information about content, its metadata, and its file extensions. The `IDocumentType` interface defines a contract for document types, including their name, content types, file extensions, and file header.

**Technical Summary**

The design pattern used in these files is the Data Transfer Object (DTO) pattern, where classes are designed to contain data and are used to transfer data between layers of an application. The `DocumentType` class, for example, encapsulates information about a document type, including its name, content types, file extensions, and file header.

The `IDocumentType` interface defines a contract for document types, which is implemented by the `DocumentType` class. This is an example of the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) design pattern, where a interface is defined that is specific to the needs of a particular application.

```plantuml
@ComponentDiagram
interface IDocumentType {
    name
    contentTypes
    fileExtensions
    fileHeader
}

class DocumentType {
    name
    contentTypes
    fileExtensions
    fileHeader
}

class ContentMetaDataReference {
    contentType
    fileName
    metaData
}

class ContentReference {
    content
    contentType
    fileName
}

* DocumentType ..> ContentMetaDataReference
* ContentMetaDataReference ..> ContentReference
```

**Files**

The following files are included in this project:

* `ContentMetaDataReference.cs`: Defines a class that represents a reference to content metadata.
* `ContentReference.cs`: Defines a class that represents a content reference containing information about content.
* `DocumentType.cs`: Defines a class that represents a document type, including its name, supported content types, file extensions, and file header.
* `IDocumentType.cs`: Defines an interface that represents a document type.
