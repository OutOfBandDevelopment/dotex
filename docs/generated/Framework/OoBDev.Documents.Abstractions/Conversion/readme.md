**Summary**

The provided source files define the `IDocumentConversionHandler` interface, which represents a handler for document conversion. This interface allows developers to create implementations that can convert documents from one format to another. The interface provides methods for getting the supported source and destination content types, and for checking whether a specific content type is supported for conversion.

**Technical Summary**

The design pattern used in this implementation is the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP), which states that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use. The `IDocumentConversionHandler` interface is divided into two parts: source-related methods (`Sources`, `SupportedSource`) and destination-related methods (`Destinations`, `SupportedDestination`). This allows clients to focus on either source or destination conversions, without being obligated to implement the other.
