**Overview**

The OoBDev.Documents system provides a set of interfaces and attributes for interacting with document-related functionalities such as blob containers, document conversion, content type detection, and document type management. This system is designed to provide a flexible and extensible architecture for applications that require robust document management capabilities.

**Technical Summary**

The OoBDev.Documents system uses various design patterns and architectural patterns to achieve its goals. The system is modularized, with each module responsible for a specific functionality such as content type detection, document conversion, or blob storage. This modular architecture allows for easy extension and customization of the system.

The system also employs the Strategy pattern to implement document conversion and content type detection. The Strategy pattern allows for the introduction of new conversion strategies and content type detectors without affecting the rest of the system.

Additionally, the system uses the Factory pattern to create instances of blob containers and document conversion handlers. This pattern allows for the decoupling of the creation of these instances from the rest of the system, making the system more flexible and easier to maintain.

  }
  
  docTools ..> blobContainer: detects content type
  docTools ..> conversionHandler: converts document
  docTools ..> contentTypeDetector: detects content type
  blobFactory ..> blobContainer: creates blob container
  conversionHandler ..> documentConversion: performs document conversion
  contentTypeDetector ..> docTools: provides content type detection

In the component diagram, we see the main components of the OoBDev.Documents system, including IDocumentTypeTools, IBlobContainer, IBlobContainerFactory, IDocumentConversionHandler, IDocumentConversion, IContentTypeDetector, and IDocumentType. The system is organized into groups representing different functionalities such as blob storage, document conversion, content type detection, and document type management.

The diagram shows the relationships between these components, illustrating how they interact with each other to provide the desired functionality. For example, IDocumentTypeTools detects content type using IContentTypeDetector, and IDocumentConversionHandler performs document conversion using IDocumentConversion.
