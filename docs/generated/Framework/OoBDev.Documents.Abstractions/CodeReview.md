Overall, the code appears to be well-structured and easy to follow. However, there are a few areas that can be improved to make it more maintainable, scalable, and robust.

Here are some suggestions:

**BlobContainerAttribute.cs**

1. Consider making `ContainerName` a required property by setting the `Required` attribute to `true`. This will prevent users of the attribute from setting an empty `ContainerName`.
2. Consider adding a `Description` property to provide a brief description of the attribute.

**OoBDev.Documents.Abstractions.csproj**

1. Consider adding a `PackageDescription` element to provide a brief description of the package.
2. Consider adding a `PackageLicenseUrl` element to provide a link to the license agreement.

**IBlobContainer.cs**

1. Consider renaming `GetContentAsync` and `GetContentMetaDataAsync` to `TryGetContentAsync` and `TryGetContentMetaDataAsync` respectively, to reflect that they return `Task<ContentReference?>` instead of `Task<ContentReference>`.
2. Consider adding a `default` implementation for `IBlobContainer<T>` to provide a basic implementation for types that don't have any specific requirements.

**IContentTypeDetector.cs**

1. Consider renaming `DetectContentTypeAsync` to `DetectContentTypeImplementationAsync` to reflect that it's an implementation-specific method.
2. Consider adding a `Try` prefix to the method name to indicate that it might throw an exception if the content type cannot be determined.

**IDocumentConversion.cs**

1. Consider renaming `ConvertAsync` to `ConvertImplementationAsync` to reflect that it's an implementation-specific method.
2. Consider adding a `Try` prefix to the method name to indicate that it might throw an exception if the conversion fails.

**General**

1. Consider adding unit tests for all interfaces and classes to ensure that they behave correctly.
2. Consider using dependency injection to inject instances of `IBlobContainer`, `IContentTypeDetector`, and `IDocumentConversion` instead of creating them manually.
3. Consider splitting the `OoBDev.Documents` namespace into smaller, more focused namespaces (e.g., `OoBDev.Documents.Core`, `OoBDev.Documents.Models`, etc.).
4. Consider using more descriptive names for methods and properties (e.g., `GetFileAsync` instead of `GetContentAsync`).
5. Consider adding XML comments to all methods and properties to provide a brief description of what they do.

Here's a revised version of the code incorporating some of these suggestions:

```csharp
namespace OoBDev.Documents
{
    [AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Class, AllowMultiple = false)]
    public class BlobContainerAttribute : Attribute
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// Required blob container name.
        /// </summary>
        [Required]
        public string ContainerName { get; set; }

        /// <summary>
        /// Brief description of the blob container.
        /// </summary>
        public string Description { get; set; }
    }

    public interface IBlobContainer
    {
        Task<ContentReference?> TryGetContentAsync(string path);
        Task<ContentMetaDataReference?> TryGetContentMetaDataAsync(string path);
        // ...
    }

    public interface IBlobContainer<T> : IBlobContainer
    {
    }

    public interface IContentTypeDetector
    {
        Task<string?> TryDetectContentTypeAsync(Stream source);
    }

    public interface IDocumentConversion
    {
        Task ConvertImplementationAsync(Stream source, string sourceContentType, Stream destination, string destinationContentType);
    }
}
```

These are just some suggestions, and the code is still maintainable as is. However, incorporating these suggestions can make the code more scalable, robust, and easy to understand.
