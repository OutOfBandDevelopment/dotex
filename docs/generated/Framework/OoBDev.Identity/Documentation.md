### Class Diagram
```plantuml
@startuml
interface IIdentityManager
+ createIdentityUserAsync(email: string, firstName: string, lastName: string): (objectId: string, password: string)

class UserManagementProvider implements IUserManagementProvider
+ UserManagementProvider(IIdentityManager? user = null)
+ createAccountAsync(UserCreateModel model): Task<UserCreatedModel>
  - dependency IIdentityManager
enduml
```

## ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs
---------------------------

Provides extension methods for adding identity-related services to the service collection.
```plantuml
@startuml
class ServiceCollectionExtensions
+ TryAddIdentityServices(IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration configuration): IServiceCollection
  - dependency Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection
  - dependency Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration
enduml
```

## UserManagementProvider.cs
---------------------------

Represents a provider for user management operations.
```plantuml
@startuml
class UserManagementProvider implements IUserManagementProvider
+ UserManagementProvider(IIdentityManager? user = null)
  - dependency IIdentityManager

+ createAccountAsync(UserCreateModel model): Task<UserCreatedModel>
  - call IIdentityManager.createIdentityUserAsync(email, firstName, lastName)
enduml
```

## Sequence Diagram
```plantuml
@startuml
actor User
participant UserManagementProvider as UP
participant IIdentityManager as IDM

note "User requests new account creation" as n1

UP->IDM: CreateIdentityUserAsync(email, firstName, lastName)
IDM->UP: (objectId, password)
UP->User: newly created user's information
enduml
```
Note: The class diagram shows the relationships between the classes and interfaces, while the sequence diagram shows the interactions between the classes and participants. The ServiceCollectionExtensions class is not shown in the sequence diagram as it is only a utility class that adds services to the service collection.
