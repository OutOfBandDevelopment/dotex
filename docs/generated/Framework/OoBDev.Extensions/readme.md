**Readme File for OoBDev.Extensions**

The OoBDev.Extensions namespace provides a collection of extension methods and utility classes for common tasks such as accessing values, configuration, file operations, stream manipulation, reflection, and string manipulation.

**Key Features**

* A range of extension methods for working with streams, files, and strings
* A collection of utility classes for reflection, string manipulation, and more
* A set of suggested IOC configurations using the Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection package

**Technical Summary**

The OoBDev.Extensions namespace utilizes various design patterns and architectural patterns to provide a comprehensive set of utility classes and extension methods. Some of the notable design patterns and architectural patterns include:

* **Builder Pattern**: Used in the CommandLine class to provide a builder pattern for command parameter arguments
* **Dependency Injection**: Used through the Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection package to provide IOC configurations
* **Extension Methods**: Used throughout the namespace to provide a range of utility methods for working with various .NET types
* **Singleton Pattern**: Used in the Accessor<T> class to provide a singleton instance of the accessor type
