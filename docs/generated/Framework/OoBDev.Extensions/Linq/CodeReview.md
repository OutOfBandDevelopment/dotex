As a senior software engineer/solutions architect, I'd be happy to review the source code and provide suggestions for improvement.

**AsyncEnumerableExtensions.cs**

1. **Naming conventions**: Follow the .NET naming conventions for variables, methods, and classes. For example, `ToListAsync` should be `ToListAsyncAsync`.
2. **Code organization**: The class has multiple methods for different operations. Consider breaking them out into separate classes or interfaces for better organization and reusability.
3. **Method naming**: Some methods, like `ToListAsync` and `AsEnumerableAsync`, have similar names. Consider making them more specific, like `ToListAsync` and `AsyncSequenceToList`.
4. **Exception handling**: Current implementation does not handle exceptions properly. Consider using `Try`-`Catch` blocks or `IAsyncEnumerable<T>` to propagate exceptions.
5. **Performance**: Some methods, like `SelectAsync`, create new enumerables. Consider using in-memory caching or concurrency control to improve performance.

**DictionaryExtensions.cs**

1. **Naming conventions**: Follow the .NET naming conventions. `ChangeComparer` should be `ChangeComparerAsync`.
2. **Code organization**: The class has a single method. Consider breaking it out into a separate class or interface for better organization and reusability.
3. **Method naming**: `TryGetValue` and `ChangeComparer` are method names that conflict with existing .NET methods. Consider using more specific names, like `TryGetValueWithComparer` and `ReplaceComparer`.

**General suggestions**

1. **Use async/await**: The code uses `await foreach` but also uses `foreach` loops. Consider using async/await consistently.
2. **Use IL-relevant abstractions**: Consider using interfaces like `IAsyncEnumerable<T>` and `IAsyncEnumerator<T>` for better type safety and compatibility.
3. **Performance monitoring**: Consider implementing performance monitoring and logging to track performance and exceptions.
4. **Code reviews**: It's essential to have multiple people review each other's code to ensure it meets the project's requirements and coding standards.

Here's a sample refactored version of the `AsyncEnumerableExtensions` class:

```csharp
public static class AsyncEnumerableExtensions
{
    public static async Task<IEnumerable<T>> AsyncSequenceToListAsync<T>(this IAsyncEnumerable<T> items)
    {
        var list = new List<T>();
        await foreach (var item in items)
        {
            list.Add(item);
        }
        return list;
    }

    public static async Task<List<T>> ToListAsyncAsync<T>(this IAsyncEnumerable<T> items)
    {
        return await items.AsyncSequenceToListAsync();
    }

    public static async IAsyncEnumerable<TResult> SelectAsync<T, TResult>(this IAsyncEnumerable<T> items, Func<T, Task<TResult>> map)
    {
        await foreach (var item in items)
        {
            yield return await map(item);
        }
    }

    public static async Task<IEnumerable<T>> AsyncSequenceToReadOnlyCollectionAsync<T>(this IAsyncEnumerable<T> items)
    {
        var collection = new Collection<T>();
        await foreach (var item in items)
        {
            collection.Add(item);
        }
        return collection.AsReadOnly();
    }
}
```

Note that this is just a sample refactored version, and actual refactoring should be based on the specific requirements and constraints of your project.
