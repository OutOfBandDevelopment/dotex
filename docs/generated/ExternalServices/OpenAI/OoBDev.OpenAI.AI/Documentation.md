Here is the documentation for the provided source code files, including class diagrams in PlantUML:

**OoBDev.OpenAI.AI.csproj**

This is a .NET Core project file for the OoBDev.OpenAI.AI library. It specifies the target framework as .NET 8.0, disables implicit usings, and enables nullable reference types. The project references several NuGet packages, including Azure.AI.OpenAI, Microsoft.Extensions.Options.ConfigurationExtensions, and Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Abstractions.

**Readme.OpenAI.AI.md**

This is a README file for the OoBDev.OpenAI.AI library. It provides an overview of the library's key components, including the ServiceCollectionExtensions, OpenAIManager, and OpenAIOptions classes.

**ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs**

This is a static class that provides extension methods for configuring OpenAI services. The TryAddOpenAIServices method takes a service collection, configuration, and optional OpenAI option section name as parameters. It adds instances of OpenAIManager to the service collection and configures OpenAI options using the provided configuration.

**Class Diagram**

Here is a class diagram for the OoBDev.OpenAI.AI library in PlantUML:
```
@startuml
class OpenAIManager {
  -method: GetResponseAsync(persistentId: int, userId: int)
  -method: GetStreamedResponseAsync(persistentId: int, userId: int)
}
class ServiceCollectionExtensions {
  -method: TryAddOpenAIServices(IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration configuration, string optionSection)
}
class OpenAIOptions {
  -property: APIKey
  -property: DeploymentName
}
class OoBDevOpenAIAI {
  -extends: OoBDev.AI
}
OoBDevOpenAIAI ..> OpenAIManager
OpenAIManager ..> ServiceCollectionExtensions
ServiceCollectionExtensions ..> OpenAIOptions
@enduml
```
This class diagram shows the relationships between the classes in the OoBDev.OpenAI.AI library. The OpenAIManager class is a part of the library and provides methods for interacting with the OpenAI language model. The ServiceCollectionExtensions class is also a part of the library and provides methods for configuring OpenAI services. The OpenAIOptions class represents options for configuring the OpenAI service. The OoBDevOpenAIAI class is the main entry point for the library and extends the OoBDev.AI class.

Note: The PlantUML syntax is used to describe the classes and their relationships.
